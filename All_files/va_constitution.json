The Office may decline to investigate any complaint. Upon declining to investigate a complaint, the Office shall notify the complainant in writing of the decision not to investigate and shall include the reasons for such decision. If the complainant is an inmate, the Office shall inform an inmate that the inmate is entitled to use the Department's policies regarding resolution of inmate grievances and shall provide information and a complete set of forms to the inmate to complete the resolution of inmate grievances. The Department shall toll any procedural deadlines imposed on inmates for filing a grievance or complaint as part of the administrative remedy process until five business days after the inmate received the information and forms from the Office by inmate legal mail process. The Office shall decline to investigate a complaint if the inmate has failed to first use the Department's policies regarding resolution of inmate grievances, unless the inmate provides evidence that the complaint is legitimate and the inmate made a good faith attempt to exhaust the administrative remedy process and was impeded or procedurally defaulted by no fault of his own. If the Office finds that inmates repeatedly assert their inability to utilize the administrative remedy process despite their good faith efforts, the Office may conduct an unannounced inspection of the facility in question to determine whether the facility is making the administrative process and grievance forms accessible to inmates.</p><p>C. The Office shall not investigate any complaints relating to an inmate's underlying criminal conviction. The Office may refer the complainant and others to the appropriate resources or state or federal agencies.</p><p>D. The Office may not levy any fees for the submission or investigation of complaints.</p><p>E. At the conclusion of an investigation, the Office shall render a decision on the merits of each complaint.

The Office shall state its recommendations and reasoning if the Office determines that the Department, or any employee or contractor thereof, should (i) consider the matter further; (ii) modify or cancel any action; (iii) alter a rule, practice, or ruling; (iv) explain in detail the administrative action in question; or (v) rectify an omission. Upon request of the Office, the Department shall inform the Office in writing about any action taken on the recommendations or the reasons for not complying with such recommendations. Aggregated information related to complaints received and complaint resolutions shall be made publicly available pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/53.1-17.8/'>53.1-17.8</a>.</p><p>F.

In the event that the Department conducts its own internal disciplinary investigation and review of one or more staff members as a result of the investigation of the Office, such disciplinary investigation and review may be subject to additional investigation and review by the Office to ensure a fair and objective process.</p><p>H. Prior to announcing a conclusion or recommendation, the Office shall consult with the Department or any person individually named in the conclusion or recommendation. The Office may request to be notified, within a specified time, by the Department of any action taken on any recommendation presented.</p><p>I. The Department and any employees or contractors thereof shall not discharge, retaliate against, or in any manner discriminate against any person because such person has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding pursuant to this article. Any alleged discharge, retaliation against, or discrimination against a complainant may be considered by the Office as an appropriate subject for investigation.</p><p>2024, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+CHAP0392'>392</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+CHAP0393'>393</a>.</p>"

Prior to the court's authorization of such treatment, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the interests of the prisoner. Evidence shall be presented concerning the prisoner's condition and proposed treatment, which evidence may, in the court's discretion and in the absence of objection by the prisoner or the prisoner's attorney, be submitted by affidavit.</p><p>C.

Such order shall require the licensed physician, psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, professional counselor, or clinical social worker acting within his area of expertise who is treating the prisoner to report to the court and the prisoner's attorney any change in the prisoner's condition resulting in restoration of the prisoner's capability to consent prior to completion of the authorized treatment and related services. Upon receipt of such report, the court may enter such order withdrawing or modifying its prior authorization as it deems appropriate. Any petition or order under this section may be orally presented or entered, provided a written order is subsequently executed.</p><p>D.

Such order shall expire after a period of 12 hours unless extended by the court as part of an order authorizing treatment under subsection A.</p><p>G. Any licensed health or mental health professional or licensed facility providing services pursuant to the court's or magistrate's authorization as provided in this section shall have no liability arising out of a claim to the extent it is based on lack of consent to such services. Any such professional or facility providing services with the consent of the prisoner receiving treatment shall have no liability arising out of a claim to the extent it is based on lack of capacity to consent if a court or a magistrate has denied a petition hereunder to authorize such services, and such denial was based on an affirmative finding that the prisoner was capable of making an informed decision regarding the proposed services.</p><p>H.

Upon the petition of the Director or his designee, any district court judge or any special justice, as defined by § <a href='/vacode/37.2-100/'>37.2-100</a>, of the county or city where the prisoner is located may issue an order authorizing involuntary admission of a prisoner who is sentenced and committed to the Department of Corrections and who is alleged or reliably reported to have a mental illness to a degree that warrants hospitalization.</p><p>B. Such prisoner may be involuntarily admitted to a hospital or facility for the care and treatment of persons with mental illness by complying with the following admission procedures:</p><p>1. A hearing on the petition shall be scheduled as soon as possible, allowing the prisoner an opportunity to prepare any defenses which he may have, obtain independent evaluation and expert opinion at his own expense, and summons other witnesses.</p><p>2. Prior to such hearing, the judge or special justice shall fully inform the prisoner of the allegations of the petition, the standard upon which he may be admitted involuntarily, the right of appeal from such hearing to the circuit court, and the right to jury trial on appeal. The judge or special justice shall ascertain if the prisoner is represented by counsel, and, if he is not represented by counsel, the judge or special justice shall appoint an attorney to represent the prisoner.</p><p>3. The judge or special justice shall require an examination of such prisoner by a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor who is licensed in Virginia or, if such psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor is not available, a physician or psychologist who is licensed in Virginia and who is qualified in the diagnosis of mental illness. The judge or special justice shall summons the examiner, who shall certify that he has personally examined the individual and has probable cause to believe that the prisoner does or does not have mental illness, that there does or does not exist a substantial likelihood that, as a result of mental illness, the prisoner will, in the near future, cause serious physical harm to himself or others as evidenced by recent behavior causing, attempting, or threatening harm and other relevant information, if any, and that the prisoner does or does not require involuntary hospitalization. The judge or special justice may accept written certification of the examiner's findings if the examination has been personally made within the preceding five days and if there is no objection to the acceptance of such written certification by the prisoner or his attorney.</p><p>4. If the judge or special justice, after observing the prisoner and obtaining the necessary positive certification and other relevant evidence, finds specifically that (i) the prisoner has a mental illness and that there exists a substantial likelihood that, as a result of mental illness, the prisoner will, in the near future, (a) cause serious physical harm to himself or others as evidenced by recent behavior causing, attempting, or threatening harm and other relevant information, if any, or (b) suffer serious harm due to his lack of capacity to protect himself from harm or to provide for his basic human needs, and (ii) alternatives to involuntary admission have been investigated and deemed unsuitable and there is no less restrictive alternative to such admission, the judge or special justice shall by written order and specific findings so certify and order that the prisoner be placed in a hospital or other facility designated by the Director for a period not to exceed 180 days from the date of the court order. Such placement shall be in a hospital or other facility for the care and treatment of persons with mental illness that is licensed or operated by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.</p><p>5. The judge or special justice shall also order that the relevant medical records of such prisoner be released to the hospital, facility, or program in which he is placed upon request of the treating physician or director of the hospital, facility, or program.</p><p>6. The Department shall prepare the forms required in procedures for admission as approved by the Attorney General. These forms, which shall be the legal forms used in such admissions, shall be distributed by the Department to the clerks of the general district courts of the various counties and cities of the Commonwealth and to the directors of the respective state hospitals.</p><p>1988, c. 873; 2005, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0716'>716</a>; 2008, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0779'>779</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0850'>850</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0870'>870</a>; 2009, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0813'>813</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0840'>840</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0945'>945</a>; 2022, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0509'>509</a>.</p>"

The authority shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this article, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as both principal and interest and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or negotiated sale, or for such price, as it may determine will best effectuate the purposes of this article.</p><p>The proceeds of the bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issuance, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds.</p><p>Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this article without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any conditions other than those proceedings or conditions which are specifically required by this article.</p><p>Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof. All such bonds shall contain a statement on their face substantially to the effect that neither the faith and credit of the Commonwealth nor the faith and credit of any county, city, town, or other subdivision of the Commonwealth is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this article shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the Commonwealth or any county, city, town, or other subdivision of the Commonwealth to levy any taxes whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment except from the funds pledged under the provisions of this article.</p><p>1990, c. 837.</p>"

However, any offender who is convicted of any of the following violations of Chapter 4 (§ <a href='/vacode/18.2-30/'>18.2-30</a> et seq.) of Title 18.2 shall not be eligible for participation in the home/electronic incarceration program: (i) first and second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter under Article 1 (§ <a href='/vacode/18.2-30/'>18.2-30</a> et seq.); (ii) mob-related felonies under Article 2 (§ <a href='/vacode/18.2-38/'>18.2-38</a> et seq.); (iii) any kidnapping or abduction felony under Article 3 (§ <a href='/vacode/18.2-47/'>18.2-47</a> et seq.); (iv) any malicious felonious assault or malicious bodily wounding under Article 4 (§ <a href='/vacode/18.2-51/'>18.2-51</a> et seq.); (v) robbery under § <a href='/vacode/18.2-58.1/'>18.2-58.1</a>; or (vi) any criminal sexual assault punishable as a felony under Article 7 (§ <a href='/vacode/18.2-61/'>18.2-61</a> et seq.).

The sheriff or administrator in charge of a local or regional correctional facility or his designee may petition the circuit court or any district court judge or any special justice, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/37.2-100/'>37.2-100</a>, herein referred to as the court, of the county or city in which the prisoner is located for an order authorizing treatment of a prisoner confined in the local or regional correctional facility. Upon filing the petition, the petitioner or the court shall serve a certified copy of the petition to the person for whom treatment is sought and, if the identity and whereabouts of the person's next of kin are known, to the person's next of kin. The court shall authorize such treatment in a facility designated by the sheriff or administrator upon finding, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that the prisoner is incapable, either mentally or physically, of giving informed consent to such treatment; that the prisoner does not have a relevant advanced directive, guardian, or other substitute decision maker; that the proposed treatment is in the best interests of the prisoner; and that the jail has sufficient medical and nursing resources available to safely administer the treatment and respond to any adverse side effects that might arise from the treatment. The facility designated for treatment by the sheriff or administrator may be located within a local or regional correctional facility if such facility is licensed to provide the treatment authorized by the court order.</p><p>B. Prior to the court's authorization of such treatment, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the interests of the prisoner. Evidence shall be presented concerning the prisoner's condition and proposed treatment, which evidence may, in the court's discretion and in the absence of objection by the prisoner or the prisoner's attorney, be submitted by affidavit.</p><p>C. Any order authorizing treatment pursuant to subsection A shall describe the treatment authorized and authorize generally such examinations, tests, medications, and other treatments as are in the best interests of the prisoner but may not authorize nontherapeutic sterilization, abortion, or psychosurgery. Such order shall require the licensed physician, psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, professional counselor, or clinical social worker acting within his area of expertise who is treating the prisoner to report to the court and the prisoner's attorney any change in the prisoner's condition resulting in restoration of the prisoner's capability to consent prior to completion of the authorized treatment and related services. Upon receipt of such report, the court may enter such order withdrawing or modifying its prior authorization as it deems appropriate. Any petition or order under this section may be orally presented or entered, provided that a written order is subsequently executed.</p><p>D. Prior to authorizing treatment pursuant to this section, the court shall find that there is no available person with legal authority under the Health Care Decisions Act (§ <a href='/vacode/54.1-2981/'>54.1-2981</a> et seq.) or under other applicable law to authorize the proposed treatment.</p><p>E. Any order of a judge under subsection A may be appealed de novo within 10 days to the circuit court for the jurisdiction where the prisoner is located, and any order of a circuit court hereunder, either originally or on appeal, may be appealed within 10 days to the Court of Appeals, which shall give such appeal priority and hear the appeal as soon as possible.</p><p>F. Whenever the director of any hospital or facility reasonably believes that treatment is necessary to protect the life, health, or safety of a prisoner, such treatment may be given during the period allowed for any appeal unless prohibited by order of a court of record wherein the appeal is pending.</p><p>G. Upon the advice of a licensed physician, psychiatrist, or clinical psychologist acting within his area of expertise who has attempted to obtain consent and upon a finding of probable cause to believe that a prisoner is incapable, due to any physical or mental condition, of giving informed consent to treatment and that the medical standard of care calls for testing, observation, or other treatment within the next 12 hours to prevent death, disability, or a serious irreversible condition, the court or, if the court is unavailable, a magistrate shall issue an order authorizing temporary admission of the prisoner to a hospital or other health care facility and authorizing such testing, observation, or other treatment. Such order shall expire after a period of 12 hours unless extended by the court as part of an order authorizing treatment under subsection A.</p><p>H. Any licensed health or mental health professional or licensed facility providing services pursuant to the court's or magistrate's authorization as provided in this section shall have no liability arising out of a claim to the extent that it is based on lack of consent to such services, except with respect to injury or death resulting from gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct. Any such professional or facility providing services with the consent of the prisoner receiving treatment shall have no liability arising out of a claim to the extent that it is based on lack of capacity to consent, except with respect to injury or death resulting from gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct, if a court or a magistrate has denied a petition hereunder to authorize such services and such denial was based on an affirmative finding that the prisoner was capable of making an informed decision regarding the proposed services.</p><p>I. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or repeal any common law rule relating to consent for medical treatment or the right to apply or the authority conferred by any other applicable statute or regulation relating to consent.</p><p>2019, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0809'>809</a>.</p>"

Provide that in any case where a person who is released on parole or postrelease supervision has been committed to the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services under the provisions of Chapter 9 (§ <a href='/vacode/37.2-900/'>37.2-900</a> et seq.) of Title 37.2 the conditions of his parole or postrelease supervision shall include the requirement that the person comply with all conditions given him by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and that he follow all of the terms of his treatment plan;</p><p>4. Revoke parole and any period of postrelease and order the reincarceration of any parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision or impose a condition of participation in any component of the Statewide Community-Based Corrections System for State-Responsible Offenders (§ <a href='/vacode/53.1-67.2/'>53.1-67.2</a> et seq.) on any eligible parolee, when, in the judgment of the Board, he has violated the conditions of his parole or postrelease supervision or is otherwise unfit to be on parole or on postrelease supervision;</p><p>5. Issue final discharges to persons released by the Board on parole when the Board is of the opinion that the discharge of the parolee will not be incompatible with the welfare of such person or of society. Final discharges granted prior to the expiration of a period of parole shall be granted only upon approval by a majority of Board members. The Board shall publish an annual report regarding final discharges issued by the Board during the previous 12 months. The report shall include (i) the name of each prisoner granted final discharge, (ii) the offense of which the prisoner was convicted, (iii) the jurisdiction in which such offense was committed, (iv) the length of the prisoner's sentence and the date such sentence was imposed, (v) the amount of time the prisoner has been on parole or postrelease supervision in the community, (vi) the basis for the final discharge, and (vii) the vote of each Board member;</p><p>6. Make investigations and reports with respect to any commutation of sentence, pardon, reprieve or remission of fine, or penalty when requested by the Governor;</p><p>7. Publish a statement by the fifteenth day of each month regarding the actions taken by the Board on the parole of prisoners during the prior month. The statement shall list (i) the name of each prisoner considered for parole, (ii) the offense of which the prisoner was convicted, (iii) the jurisdiction in which such offense was committed, (iv) the length of the prisoner's sentence and the date such sentence was imposed, (v) the amount of time the prisoner has served, (vi) whether the prisoner was granted or denied parole, (vii) individualized reasons for the grant or denial of parole, and (viii) the final vote and the names of the Board members who voted in favor of granting parole and those who voted against. However, in the case of a prisoner granted parole, the information set forth in clauses (i) through (viii) regarding such prisoner shall be included in the statement published in the month immediately succeeding the month in which notification of the decision to grant parole was given to the attorney for the Commonwealth and any victims;</p><p>8. Publish an annual report regarding actions taken by the Board on the parole of prisoners during the prior year. Such report shall contain each monthly statement published by the Board pursuant to subdivision 7 and a summary that identifies (i) the total number of prisoners considered for parole, (ii) the number of persons granted parole, (iii) the number of persons denied parole, and (iv) the most common reasons for which parole was granted or denied;</p><p>9. Ensure that each person eligible for parole receives a timely and thorough review of his suitability for release on parole, including a review of any relevant post-sentencing information. If parole is denied, the basis for the denial of parole shall be in writing and shall give specific, individualized reasons for such denial to such inmate; and</p><p>10. Convene a public meeting, either in person or via video conference, when conducting the final deliberation and vote regarding whether the Board will grant parole to a prisoner. The prisoner being considered for parole or his attorney shall be permitted to attend such meeting either, in the Board's discretion, in person or via video conference. The victim shall be permitted to attend and participate in such meeting either, in the Board's discretion, in person or via video or phone conference or to provide written or recorded testimony. No decision to grant discretionary parole shall be made by the Board unless such decision was discussed and debated at a meeting at which a majority of the Board members were present. Whether the Board grants or denies discretionary parole to an inmate, each Board member shall identify his reasoning for such decision at the time such member's vote is cast.</p><p>Code 1950, §§ 53-238, 53-265; 1966, c. 638; 1970, c. 648; 1973, c. 253; 1974, cc. 44, 45; 1979, c. 625; 1982, c. 636; 1990, c. 538; 2000, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0338'>338</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?001+ful+CHAP0767'>767</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0569'>569</a>; 2003, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?031+ful+CHAP0132'>132</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0657'>657</a>; 2006, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0863'>863</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0914'>914</a>; 2009, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0813'>813</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0840'>840</a>; 2013, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0708'>708</a>; 2020, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0002'>2</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0529'>529</a>; 2021, Sp.

If additional victim research is necessary, electronic notification shall be sent to the attorney for the Commonwealth and the director of the victim/witness program, if one exists, of the jurisdiction in which the offense occurred.

Once testimony is submitted by a victim, such testimony shall remain in the prisoner's parole file and shall be considered by the Board at every parole review. The victim of a crime for which the prisoner is incarcerated may submit a request in writing or by electronic means to the Board to be notified of (i) the prisoner's parole eligibility date and mandatory release date as determined by the Department of Corrections, (ii) any parole-related interview dates, and (iii) the Board's decision regarding parole for the prisoner. The victim may request that the Board only notify the victim if, following its review, the Board is inclined to grant parole to the prisoner, in which case the victim shall have 45 days to present written or oral testimony for the Board's consideration. If the victim has requested to be notified only if the Board is inclined to grant parole and no testimony, either written or oral, is received from the victim within at least 45 days of the date of the Board's notification, the Board shall render its decision based on information available to it in accordance with subsection A.

That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called \"sending state\"), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called \"receiving state\"), while on probation or parole, if:</p><p>a. Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;</p><p>b. Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.</p> <p>Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.</p> <p>A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this compact, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.</p><p>2. That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.</p><p>3. That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.</p><p>4. That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.</p><p>5. That the Governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.</p><p>6. That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.</p><p>7. That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six months' notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.</p><p>Code 1950, § 53-289; 1982, c. 636.</p>"

    "Body": "<p>This article may be cited as \"The Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders.\" The Governor shall execute, on behalf of the Commonwealth, with any other state or states legally joining therein a compact that shall be in form substantially as follows:</p><p>ARTICLE I. </p><p>PURPOSE.</p><p>The Compacting States to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each Compacting State in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The Compacting States also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</p><p>It is the purpose of this Compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the Compacting States: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the Compact among the Compacting States. In addition, this Compact will: create an Interstate Commission, which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies and which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this Compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of State Councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.</p><p>The Compacting States recognize that there is no \"right\" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this Compact and the Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the Compacting States that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.</p><p>ARTICLE II. </p><p>DEFINITIONS.</p><p>As used in this Compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:</p><p>1. \"Adult\" means both individuals legally classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute, or operation of law.</p><p>2. \"Bylaws\" means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling the Interstate Commission's actions or conduct.</p><p>3. \"Compact Administrator\" means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this Compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this Compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the State Council under this Compact.</p><p>4. \"Compacting State\" means any state that has enacted the enabling legislation for this Compact.</p><p>5. \"Commissioner\" means the voting representative of each Compacting State appointed pursuant to Article III of this Compact.</p><p>6. \"Interstate Commission\" means the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision established by this Compact.</p><p>7. \"Member\" means the Commissioner of a Compacting State or designee, who shall be a person officially connected with the Commissioner.</p><p>8. \"Noncompacting State\" means any State that has not enacted the enabling legislation for this Compact.</p><p>9. \"Offender\" means an adult placed under, or subject to, supervision as the result of the commission of a criminal offense and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies.</p><p>10. \"Person\" means any individual, corporation, business enterprise, or other legal entity, either public or private.</p><p>11. \"Rules\"  means acts of the Interstate Commission, duly promulgated pursuant to Article VIII of this Compact, substantially affecting interested parties in addition to the Interstate Commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the Compacting States.</p><p>12. \"State\" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia and any other territorial possessions of the United States.</p><p>13. \"State Council\" means the resident members of the State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision created by each State under Article III of this Compact.</p><p>ARTICLE III. </p><p>THE COMPACT COMMISSION.</p><p>The Compacting States hereby create the \"Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.\" The Interstate Commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the Compacting States.

In addition to appointment of its Commissioner to the national Interstate Commission, each State Council shall exercise oversight and advocacy concerning its participation in Interstate Commission activities and other duties as may be determined by each member state including but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the Compact within that state.</p><p>ARTICLE V. </p><p>POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall have the following powers:</p><p>1.

To elect or appoint such officers, attorneys, employees, agents, consultants, and to fix their compensation, define their duties and determine their qualifications; and to establish the Interstate Commission's personnel policies and programs relating to, among other things, conflicts of interest, rates of compensation, and qualifications of personnel.</p><p>10. To accept any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, and to receive, utilize, and dispose of same.</p><p>11.

The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes that shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each Member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of offenders as directed through its Bylaws and Rules, which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements.</p><p>ARTICLE VIII. </p><p>RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall promulgate Rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the Compact including transition rules governing administration of the Compact during the period in which it is being considered and enacted by the States.</p><p>Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the Bylaws and Rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.S. § 551 et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C.S. app. 2, § 1 et seq., as may be amended (hereinafter APA).

If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, as defined in the APA, in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside.</p><p>Subjects to be addressed within 12 months after the first meeting must at a minimum include:</p><p>1.

In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compacting State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact, which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.</p><p>Section B. Dispute Resolution.</p><p>The Compacting States shall report to the Interstate Commission on issues or activities of concern to them, and cooperate with and support the Interstate Commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to the Compact and may arise among Compacting States and Noncompacting States.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall enact a Bylaw or promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the Compacting States.</p><p>Section C.

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the State and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each Compacting State and shall promulgate a Rule binding upon all Compacting States, which governs said assessment.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the Compacting States, except by and with the authority of the Compacting State.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its Bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.</p><p>ARTICLE XI. </p><p>COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT.</p><p>Any State, as defined in Article II of this Compact, is eligible to become a Compacting State. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than 35 of the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2002, or upon enactment into law by the 35th State. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other Compacting State, upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of nonmember States or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the Compact by all States and territories of the United States.</p><p>Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States.</p><p>ARTICLE XII. </p><p>WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT.</p><p>Section A. Withdrawal.</p><p>Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (hereinafter Withdrawing State) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the Compact into law.</p><p>The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.</p><p>The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.</p><p>The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</p><p>Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.</p><p>Section B. Default.</p><p>If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (hereinafter Defaulting State) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:</p><p>1. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;</p><p>2. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;</p><p>3. Suspension and termination of membership in the Compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the Bylaws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council.</p><p>The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this Compact, Interstate Commission Bylaws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the majority and minority leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the State Council of such termination.</p><p>The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.</p><p>The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State.</p><p>Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.</p><p>Section C. Judicial Enforcement.</p><p>The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provision of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and Bylaws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p><p>Section D. Dissolution of Compact.</p><p>The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State that reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State. Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Bylaws.</p><p>ARTICLE XIII. </p><p>SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION.</p><p>The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.</p><p>The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.</p><p>ARTICLE XIV. </p><p>BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS.</p><p>Section A. Other Laws.</p><p>Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact.</p><p>All Compacting States' laws conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</p><p>Section B. Binding Effect of the Compact.</p><p>All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules and Bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States.</p><p>All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms.</p><p>Upon the request of the party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.</p><p>In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.</p><p>2004, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0407'>407</a>.</p>"

A person's classification and calculation of earned sentence credits shall not be lowered or withheld due to a lack of programming, educational, or employment opportunities at the correctional facility at which the person is confined. Records from this review, including an explanation of the reasons why a person's classification level was or was not adjusted, shall be maintained in the person's correctional file.</p><p>D. A person's classification level under subsection B may be immediately reviewed and adjusted following removal from a program, job assignment, or educational curriculum that was assigned pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/53.1-32.1/'>53.1-32.1</a> for disciplinary or noncompliance reasons.</p><p>E. A person may appeal a reclassification determination under subsection C or D in the manner set forth in the grievance procedure established by the Director pursuant to his powers and duties as set forth in § <a href='/vacode/53.1-10/'>53.1-10</a>.</p><p>F.

    "Body": "<p>The Agreement on Detainers is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this Commonwealth with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p><p>THE AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS</p><p>The contracting states solemnly agree:</p><p>ARTICLE I. </p><p>The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.</p><p>As used in this agreement:</p><p>ARTICLE II.</p><p>(a) \"State\" shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p>(b) \"Sending state\" shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof.</p><p>(c) \"Receiving state\" shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV hereof.</p><p>ARTICLE III.</p><p>(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within 180 days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officers' jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint; provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.</p><p>(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.</p><p>(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.</p><p>(d) Any request or final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other officials having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p><p>(e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.</p><p>(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.</p><p>ARTICLE IV.</p><p>(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated; provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.</p><p>(b) Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.</p><p>(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.</p><p>(d) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.</p><p>(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p><p>ARTICLE V.</p><p>(a) In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place of trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.</p><p>(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:</p><p>(1) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given.</p><p>(2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.</p><p>(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.</p><p>(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.</p><p>(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.</p><p>(f) During the continuance or temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.</p><p>(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.</p><p>(h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.</p><p>ARTICLE VI.</p><p>(a) In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.</p><p>(b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.</p><p>ARTICLE VII. </p><p>Each state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.</p><p>ARTICLE VIII. </p><p>This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.</p><p>ARTICLE IX. </p><p>This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p><p>Code 1950, § 53-304.1; 1970, c. 407; 1982, c. 636.</p>"

    "Body": "<p>The Governor is authorized and requested to execute, on behalf of the Commonwealth, with any other state or states legally joining therein a compact which shall be in form substantially as follows:</p><p>The contracting states solemnly agree that:</p><p>ARTICLE I. </p><p>The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, and with the Federal Government, thereby serving the best interest of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.</p><p>ARTICLE II. </p><p>As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</p><p>a. \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p>b. \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had.</p><p>c. \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had.</p><p>d. \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution.</p><p>e. \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for individuals with mental illness or intellectual disability, in which inmates as defined in d above may lawfully be confined.</p><p>ARTICLE III.</p><p>a. Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states, or with the Federal Government, for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for:</p><p>(1) Its duration.</p><p>(2) Payments to be made to the receiving state or to the Federal Government, by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance.</p><p>(3) Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any; the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom.</p><p>(4) Delivery and retaking of inmates.</p><p>(5) Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states.</p><p>b. The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith.</p><p>ARTICLE IV.</p><p>a. Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.</p><p>b. The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.</p><p>c. Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.</p><p>d. Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.</p><p>e. All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.</p><p>f. Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.</p><p>g. Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.</p><p>h. Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.</p><p>i. The parents, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.</p><p>ARTICLE V.</p><p>a. Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharge from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.</p><p>b. An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.</p><p>ARTICLE VI. </p><p>Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally-aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.</p><p>ARTICLE VII. </p><p>This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state.</p><p>ARTICLE VIII. </p><p>This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate official of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notice provided in said statute has been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.</p><p>ARTICLE IX. </p><p>Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.</p><p>ARTICLE X </p><p>The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p><p>Code 1950, § 53-304.9; 1977, c. 339; 1982, c. 636; 2012, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0476'>476</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0507'>507</a>.</p>"

In addition to such rules, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals shall have the authority to promulgate any other rules they deem necessary to govern electronic media and still photography coverage in their respective courts. The following rules shall serve as guidelines, and a violation of these rules may be punishable as contempt:</p><p>Coverage Allowed.</p><p>1. The presiding judge shall at all times have authority to prohibit, interrupt or terminate electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings. The presiding judge shall advise the parties of such coverage in advance of the proceedings and shall allow the parties to object thereto. For good cause shown, the presiding judge may prohibit coverage in any case and may restrict coverage as he deems appropriate to meet the ends of justice.</p><p>2.

Coverage of the following categories of witnesses shall be prohibited: police informants, minors, undercover agents and victims and families of victims of sexual offenses.</p><p>4. Coverage of jurors shall be prohibited expressly at any stage of a judicial proceeding, including that portion of a proceeding during which a jury is selected. The judge shall inform all potential jurors at the beginning of the jury selection process of this prohibition.</p><p>5. To protect the attorney-client privilege and the right to counsel, there shall be no recording or broadcast of sound from such conferences which occur in a court facility between attorneys and their clients, between co-counsel of a client, between adverse counsel, or between counsel and the presiding judge held at the bench or in chambers.</p><p>Location of Equipment and Personnel.</p><p>1.

The names of the persons so designated shall be forwarded to the chief judge of the court in the county or city in which coverage is desired so that arrangements can be made for the \"pooling\" of equipment and personnel. Such persons shall also be the only persons authorized to speak for the media to the presiding judge concerning the coverage of any judicial proceedings.</p><p>Equipment and Personnel.</p><p>1. No distracting lights or sounds shall be permitted.</p><p>2. Not more than two television cameras shall be permitted in any proceeding.</p><p>3.

The microphones and wiring must be unobtrusive and shall be located in places designated in advance of any proceeding by the chief judge of the court in which coverage is desired.</p><p>5. Any \"pooling\" arrangements among the media required by these limitations on equipment and personnel shall be the sole responsibility of the media without calling upon the presiding judge to mediate any dispute as to the appropriate media representative or equipment authorized to cover a particular proceeding. In the absence of advance media agreement on disputed equipment or personnel issues, the presiding judge may exclude all contesting media personnel from a proceeding.</p><p>6. In no event shall the number of personnel in the designated area exceed the number necessary to operate the designated equipment.</p><p>7. Only television photographic and audio equipment which does not produce distracting sound or light shall be employed to cover judicial proceedings. No artificial lighting device of any kind shall be employed in connection with the television camera.</p><p>8. Only still camera equipment which does not produce distracting sound or light shall be employed to cover judicial proceedings. No artificial lighting device of any kind shall be employed in connection with a still camera.</p><p>9.

Following a decision on the motion, whether it is granted or denied, the motion, order or orders, and all other papers or information related to the proceedings or expert assistance sought shall remain under seal.

Upon the filing of such a motion, the defendant may request a hearing for the limited purpose of identifying the human biological evidence or representative samples that are to be stored in accordance with the provisions of this section. Upon the granting of the motion, the court shall order the clerk of the circuit court to transfer all such evidence to the Department of Forensic Science. The Department of Forensic Science shall store, preserve, and retain such evidence.

In any proceeding under this section, the court, upon a finding that the physical evidence is of such a nature, size or quantity that storage, preservation or retention of all of the evidence is impractical, may order the storage of only representative samples of the evidence.

In any case in which the clerk has determined that a DNA sample is not stored in the DNA data bank, or in any case in which electronic access to the DNA data bank sample tracking system is not available in the courtroom, the court shall order that the defendant appear within 30 days before the sheriff or probation officer and allow the sheriff or probation officer to take the required sample. The order shall also require that, if the defendant has not appeared and allowed the sheriff or probation officer to take the required sample by the date stated in the order, then the sheriff or probation officer shall report to the court the defendant's failure to appear and provide the required sample.</p><p>After conviction and upon sentencing of an active participant or member of a criminal street gang, the court may, as a condition for suspending the imposition of the sentence in whole or in part or for placing the accused on probation, place reasonable restrictions on those persons with whom the accused may have contact. Such restrictions may include prohibiting the accused from having contact with anyone whom he knows to be a member of a criminal street gang, except that contact with a family or household member, as defined in § <a href='/vacode/16.1-228/'>16.1-228</a>, shall be permitted unless expressly prohibited by the court.</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case where a defendant is convicted of a violation of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-48/'>18.2-48</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-61/'>18.2-61</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-63/'>18.2-63</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-67.1/'>18.2-67.1</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-67.2/'>18.2-67.2</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-67.3/'>18.2-67.3</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-370/'>18.2-370</a>, or <a href='/vacode/18.2-370.1/'>18.2-370.1</a>, committed on or after July 1, 2006, and some portion of the sentence is suspended, the judge shall order that the period of suspension shall be for a length of time at least equal to the statutory maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned, and the defendant shall be placed on probation for that period of suspension subject to revocation by the court. The conditions of probation may include such conditions as the court shall determine, including active supervision. Where the conviction is for a violation of clause (iii) of subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-61/'>18.2-61</a>, subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-67.1/'>18.2-67.1</a>, or subdivision A 1 of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-67.2/'>18.2-67.2</a>, the court shall order that at least three years of the probation include active supervision of the defendant under a postrelease supervision program operated by the Department of Corrections, and for at least three years of such active supervision, the defendant shall be subject to electronic monitoring by means of a GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking device, or other similar device.</p><p>If a person is sentenced to jail upon conviction of a misdemeanor or a felony, the court may, at any time before the sentence has been completely served, suspend the unserved portion of any such sentence, place the person on probation in accordance with the provisions of this section, or otherwise modify the sentence imposed.</p><p>If a person has been sentenced for a felony to the Department of Corrections (the Department), the court that heard the case, if it appears compatible with the public interest and there are circumstances in mitigation of the offense, may, at any time before the person is transferred to the Department, or within 60 days of such transfer, suspend or otherwise modify the unserved portion of such a sentence.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person, who on or after July 1, 2005 commits and is convicted of a crime in violation of § <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-248/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-248/'>18.2-248</a> involving the manufacture of any controlled substance, may be ordered, upon presentation of suitable evidence of such costs, by the court to reimburse the Commonwealth or the locality for the costs incurred by the jurisdiction, as the case may be, for the removal and remediation associated with the illegal manufacture of any controlled substance by the defendant.</p><p>B. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who, on or after July 1, 2015, commits and is convicted of a violation of § <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-138/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-138/'>18.2-138</a> for damage to the Capitol or any building, monument, statuary, artwork, or other state property in Capitol Square, or at any other property assigned to the Capitol Police, shall be ordered to pay restitution to the Commonwealth for the full amount of damages.

At or before the time of sentencing, the court shall receive and consider any plan for making restitution submitted by the defendant. The plan shall include the defendant's home address, place of employment and address, social security number and bank information. If the court finds such plan to be reasonable and practical under the circumstances, it may consider probation or suspension of whatever portion of the sentence that it deems appropriate. By order of the court incorporating the defendant's plan or a reasonable and practical plan devised by the court, the defendant shall make restitution while he is free on probation or work release or following his release from confinement. Additionally, the court may order that the defendant make restitution during his confinement, if feasible, based upon both his earning capacity and net worth as determined by the court at sentencing.</p><p>D. At the time of sentencing, the court shall determine the amount to be repaid by the defendant and the terms and conditions thereof. If community service work is ordered, the court shall determine the terms and conditions upon which such work shall be performed. The court shall include such findings in the judgment order. The order shall specify that sums paid under such order shall be paid to the clerk, who shall disburse such sums as the court may, by order, direct. The clerk shall record receipt of restitution payments in an automated financial management system operated and maintained by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court or such other system established and maintained by a circuit court clerk pursuant to § <a href=\"/vacode/17.1-502/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/17.1-502/'>17.1-502</a>.

At the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the amount of restitution to be repaid by the defendant, the date by which all restitution is to be paid, the terms and conditions of such repayment, and the victim's name and contact information, including the victim's home address, telephone number, and email address, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia. If the attorney for the Commonwealth participated in the prosecution of the defendant, the attorney for the Commonwealth or his designee shall complete, to the extent possible, all portions of the form excluding the amount of restitution to be repaid by the defendant and the terms and conditions of such repayment. If the attorney for the Commonwealth did not participate in the prosecution of the defendant, the court or the clerk shall complete the form. A copy of the form, excluding contact information for the victim, shall be provided to the defendant at sentencing. A copy of the form shall be provided to the attorney for the Commonwealth and to the victim, his agent, or his estate upon request and free of charge. Except as provided in this section or otherwise required by law, the victim's contact information shall be confidential, and the clerk shall not disclose such confidential information to any person.</p><p>F. 1. In any case in which the court orders the defendant to pay restitution and places the defendant on probation that includes a period of active supervision, the probation agency supervising the defendant shall notify the court and the attorney for the Commonwealth of the amount of any restitution that remains unsatisfied and the last known address for the defendant (i) 60 days prior to the defendant's release from supervision pursuant to the terms of the sentencing order or (ii) if the agency requests that the defendant be released from supervision, at the time the agency submits its request to the court. Such notice shall be in writing and the attorney for the Commonwealth shall, if practicable, provide a copy of the notice to the victim. If any amount of restitution remains unsatisfied, the court shall conduct a hearing prior to the defendant's release from supervision after providing notice of the hearing to the defendant and the attorney for the Commonwealth. If the court finds that the defendant is not in compliance with the restitution order, the court may (a) release the defendant from supervision, (b) modify the period or terms of supervision pursuant to § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-304/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-304/'>19.2-304</a>, (c) revoke some or all of the suspended sentence or probation pursuant to § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-306/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-306/'>19.2-306</a>, or (d) proceed in accordance with subsection E of § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-358/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-358/'>19.2-358</a>. The court shall also docket the restitution order pursuant to subsection B of § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-305.2/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-305.2/'>19.2-305.2</a> unless such order has previously been docketed. Any defendant who is released from supervision shall be subject to the provisions of subdivision 3.</p><p>2. In any case in which the court orders the defendant to pay restitution and places the defendant on probation that does not include a period of active supervision, the court shall include in the order a date, not to exceed two years from the date of the entry of the order or, if the court has sentenced the defendant to an active term of incarceration, from the date of the defendant's release from incarceration, on which the defendant's compliance with the restitution order shall be reviewed and the court shall schedule a hearing for such date. The court may, on its own motion, cancel the hearing if the amount of restitution has been satisfied. If at the hearing the court finds that the defendant is not in compliance with the restitution order, the court may (i) modify the period or terms of probation pursuant to § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-304/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-304/'>19.2-304</a>, (ii) revoke some or all of the suspended sentence or probation pursuant to § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-306/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-306/'>19.2-306</a>, or (iii) proceed in accordance with the provisions of subsection E of § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-358/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-358/'>19.2-358</a>. The court shall also docket the restitution order pursuant to subsection B of § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-305.2/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-305.2/'>19.2-305.2</a> unless such order has previously been docketed. After the hearing conducted pursuant to this subdivision, the defendant shall be subject to the provisions of subdivision 3.</p><p>3. If any amount of restitution remains unsatisfied at the time of a hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision 1 or 2, the court shall continue to schedule hearings to review the defendant's compliance with the restitution order until the amount of restitution has been satisfied and provide notice of such hearings to the defendant. The court may, on its own motion, cancel any such hearing if the amount of restitution has been satisfied or if the defendant is in compliance with the restitution order. If at any hearing conducted pursuant to this subdivision the court finds that the defendant is not in compliance with the restitution order, the court may (i) modify the period or terms of probation pursuant to § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-304/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-304/'>19.2-304</a>, (ii) revoke some or all of the suspended sentence or probation pursuant to § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-306/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-306/'>19.2-306</a>, or (iii) proceed in accordance with the provisions of subsection E of § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-358/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-358/'>19.2-358</a>. The court shall follow the procedures set forth in this subdivision for the purpose of reviewing compliance with a restitution order by a defendant (a) until the amount of restitution has been satisfied or (b) if any amount of restitution remains unsatisfied, for the longer of 10 years from the date of the hearing held pursuant to subdivision 1 or 2 or the period of probation ordered by the court.</p><p>4. If the court determines at any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection that the defendant is unable to pay restitution and will remain unable to pay restitution for the duration of the review period set forth in subdivision 3, the court may discontinue any further hearings to review a defendant's compliance with the restitution order.</p><p>5. If the court determines that a defendant would be incarcerated on the date of any hearing scheduled pursuant to this subsection, the court may remove the case from the docket, reschedule such hearing to a date after the defendant's release from incarceration, and provide notice of the hearing to the defendant and the attorney for the Commonwealth. If the defendant who is on probation that includes a period of active supervision is incarcerated, the probation agency supervising the defendant shall notify the court when the defendant has been released from incarceration.</p><p>6. No provision of this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the court from exercising any authority otherwise granted by law over a defendant during any period of probation ordered by the court.</p><p>7. At every hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision 1 where the defendant was convicted of an offense for which a report to the Central Criminal Records Exchange is required under subsection A of § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-390/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-390/'>19.2-390</a>, if the court has not previously verified that the conviction for such offense appears on the criminal history record of the defendant, the court shall review the criminal history record of the defendant and determine whether the present conviction appears on that record. The probation officer for the defendant shall provide the criminal history record to the court at such hearing. If the present conviction does not appear on the criminal history record, the court shall order that the fingerprints and photograph of the defendant be taken by a law-enforcement officer and submitted to the Central Criminal Records Exchange. If fingerprints and a photograph have previously been taken for such conviction, the probation officer shall provide written or electronic notification to the Central Criminal Records Exchange within the Department of State Police that the conviction does not appear on the offender's criminal history record prior to his release from supervision.</p><p>8. At every hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision 2 where the attorney for the Commonwealth participated in the prosecution and the defendant was convicted of an offense for which a report to the Central Criminal Records Exchange is required under subsection A of § <a href=\"/vacode/19.2-390/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/19.2-390/'>19.2-390</a>, if the court has not previously verified that the conviction for such offense appears on the criminal history record of the defendant, the court shall review the criminal history record of the defendant and determine whether the present conviction appears on that record. If the attorney for the Commonwealth participated in the prosecution of the offense, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall provide the criminal history record to the court at such hearing. If the present conviction does not appear on the criminal history record, the court shall order that the fingerprints and photograph of the defendant be taken by a law-enforcement officer and submitted to the Central Criminal Records Exchange. If fingerprints and a photograph have previously been taken for such conviction, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall provide written or electronic notification to the Central Criminal Records Exchange within the Department of State Police that the conviction does not appear on the offender's criminal history record.</p><p>G. Unreasonable failure to execute the plan by the defendant shall result in revocation of the probation or imposition of the suspended sentence. A hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of this Code relating to revocation of probation or imposition of a suspended sentence before either such action is taken.</p><p>H. A defendant convicted of an offense under § <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.1/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.1/'>18.2-374.1</a>, <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.1:1/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.1:1/'>18.2-374.1:1</a>, or <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.3/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.3/'>18.2-374.3</a> shall be ordered to pay mandatory restitution to the victim of the offense in an amount as determined by the court. For purposes of this subsection, \"victim\" means a person who is depicted in a still or videographic image involved in an offense under § <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.1/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.1/'>18.2-374.1</a>, <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.1:1/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.1:1/'>18.2-374.1:1</a>, or <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.3/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.3/'>18.2-374.3</a>.</p><p>The Commonwealth shall make reasonable efforts to notify victims of offenses under § <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.1/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.1/'>18.2-374.1</a>, <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.1:1/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.1:1/'>18.2-374.1:1</a>, or <a href=\"/vacode/18.2-374.3/\" data-mce-href='/vacode/18.2-374.3/'>18.2-374.3</a>.</p><p>I. If restitution is ordered to be paid by the defendant to the victim of a crime and the victim can no longer be located or identified, the clerk shall deposit any such restitution collected to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund for the benefit of crime victims by November 1 of each year. If a clerk does not have any such restitution to deposit, the clerk shall provide a statement to that effect to the Fund by November 1 of each year. The administrator shall reserve a sum sufficient in the Fund from which he shall make prompt payment directly to the victim for any proper claims. When depositing such restitution to the Fund, the clerk shall report the victim's last known contact information, including the victim's home address, telephone number, and email address, and the amount of restitution being deposited for that victim. Before making the deposit, the administrator shall record the name, contact information, and amount of restitution being deposited for each victim appearing from the clerk's report to be entitled to restitution.

An order of restitution shall be docketed, in the name of the Commonwealth, or a locality if applicable, on behalf of the victim, as provided in § <a href='/vacode/8.01-446/'>8.01-446</a> when so ordered by the court, unless the victim named in the order of restitution requests in writing that the order be docketed in the name of the victim.

At any time before a judgment for restitution docketed in the name of the Commonwealth or a locality is satisfied, the court shall, at the written request of the victim, order the circuit court clerk to execute and docket an assignment of the judgment to the victim. The circuit court clerk shall remove from its automated financial system the amount of unpaid restitution upon docketing the assignment. If a judge of a district court orders the circuit court clerk to execute and docket an assignment of the judgment to the victim, the district court clerk shall remove from its automated financial system the amount of unpaid restitution upon sending the order to the circuit court clerk. If the victim requests that the order of restitution be docketed in the name of the victim or that a judgment for restitution previously docketed in the name of the Commonwealth or a locality be assigned to the victim, the victim shall provide to the court an address where the defendant can mail payment for the amount due and such address shall not be confidential. When a judgment for restitution previously docketed in the name of the Commonwealth or a locality is ordered to be assigned to the victim, the court shall provide notice of such order to the defendant at the defendant's last known address and shall include the mailing address provided by the victim. Enforcement by a victim of any order of restitution docketed as provided in § <a href='/vacode/8.01-446/'>8.01-446</a> is not subject to any statute of limitations.

If neither a probation period nor a period of suspension was fixed by the court, then the court may revoke the suspension for any cause the court deems sufficient that occurred within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned.</p><p>B. The court may not conduct a hearing to revoke the suspension of sentence unless the court issues process to notify the accused or to compel his appearance before the court within 90 days of receiving notice of the alleged violation or within one year after the expiration of the period of probation or the period of suspension, whichever is sooner, or, in the case of a failure to pay restitution, within three years after such expiration.

For the purposes of this section, \"technical violation\" means a violation based on the probationer's failure to (i) report any arrest, including traffic tickets, within three days to the probation officer; (ii) maintain regular employment or notify the probation officer of any changes in employment; (iii) report within three days of release from incarceration; (iv) permit the probation officer to visit his home and place of employment; (v) follow the instructions of the probation officer, be truthful and cooperative, and report as instructed; (vi) refrain from the use of alcoholic beverages to the extent that it disrupts or interferes with his employment or orderly conduct; (vii) refrain from the use, possession, or distribution of controlled substances or related paraphernalia; (viii) refrain from the use, ownership, possession, or transportation of a firearm; (ix) gain permission to change his residence or remain in the Commonwealth or other designated area without permission of the probation officer; or (x) maintain contact with the probation officer whereby his whereabouts are no longer known to the probation officer. Multiple technical violations arising from a single course of conduct or a single incident or considered at the same revocation hearing shall not be considered separate technical violations for the purposes of sentencing pursuant to this section.</p><p>B. If the court finds the basis of a violation of the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence or probation is that the defendant was convicted of a criminal offense that was committed after the date of the suspension, or has violated another condition other than (i) a technical violation or (ii) a good conduct violation that did not result in a criminal conviction, then the court may revoke the suspension and impose or resuspend any or all of that period previously suspended.</p><p>C. The court shall not impose a sentence of a term of active incarceration upon a first technical violation of the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence or probation, and there shall be a presumption against imposing a sentence of a term of active incarceration for any second technical violation of the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence or probation. However, if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed a second technical violation and he cannot be safely diverted from active incarceration through less restrictive means, the court may impose not more than 14 days of active incarceration for a second technical violation. The court may impose whatever sentence might have been originally imposed for a third or subsequent technical violation. For the purposes of this subsection, a first technical violation based on clause (viii) or (x) of subsection A shall be considered a second technical violation, and any subsequent technical violation also based on clause (viii) or (x) of subsection A shall be considered a third or subsequent technical violation.</p><p>D. The limitations on sentencing in this section shall not apply to the extent that an additional term of incarceration is necessary to allow a defendant to be evaluated for or to participate in a court-ordered drug, alcohol, or mental health treatment program. In such case, the court shall order the shortest term of incarceration possible to achieve the required evaluation or participation.</p><p>2021, Sp. Sess.

If a sample from the person is stored in the DNA data bank as indicated by the Department of Forensic Science DNA data bank sample tracking system, no additional sample shall be taken. A fee of $53 shall be charged for the withdrawal of this sample. The fee shall be taxed as part of the costs of the criminal case resulting in the conviction and $15 of the fee shall be paid into the general fund of the locality where the sample was taken and $38 of the fee shall be paid into the general fund of the state treasury.

    "Body": "<p>A. As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:</p><p>\"Intractable behavior\" means behavior that, in the determination of the Department of Corrections, (i) indicates an inmate's unwillingness or inability to conform his behavior to that necessary to his successful completion of the program or (ii) is so disruptive as to threaten the successful completion of the program by other participants.</p><p>\"Nonviolent felony\" means any felony except those considered an \"act of violence\" pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-297.1/'>19.2-297.1</a> or any attempt to commit any of those crimes.</p><p>B. A defendant (i) who otherwise would have been sentenced to incarceration for a nonviolent felony and whose identified risks and needs the court determines cannot be addressed by conventional probation supervision or (ii) whose suspension of sentence would otherwise be revoked after a finding that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of probation for a nonviolent felony, may be considered for commitment to a community corrections alternative program established under § <a href='/vacode/53.1-67.9/'>53.1-67.9</a> as follows:</p><p>1. Following conviction and prior to imposition of sentence or following a finding that the defendant's probation should be revoked, upon motion of the defendant or the attorney for the Commonwealth or upon the court's own motion, the court may order such defendant referred to the Department of Corrections for evaluation and diagnosis. When a defendant who has not been charged with a new criminal offense and who may be subject to a revocation of probation scores incarceration on the probation violation guidelines and agrees to participate, the probation and parole officer, prior to the approval of the court, may refer such defendant to the Department for such evaluation and diagnosis. Evaluation and diagnosis shall occur within 45 days of the date of commitment by the Department to determine eligibility and suitability for participation in the community corrections alternative program. The evaluation and diagnosis may be conducted by the Department at any state or local correctional facility, probation or parole office, or other location deemed appropriate by the Department.</p><p>2. Upon determination that (i) such commitment is in the best interest of the Commonwealth and the defendant and (ii) facilities are available for the confinement of the defendant, the Department shall recommend to the court in writing that the defendant be committed to the community corrections alternative program. The Department shall have the final authority to determine an individual's eligibility and suitability for the program.</p><p>3. Upon receipt of such a recommendation and a determination by the court that the defendant will benefit from the community corrections alternative program and is capable of returning to society as a productive citizen following successful completion of the program, and if the defendant would otherwise be committed to the Department, the court (i) shall impose sentence, suspend the sentence, and place the defendant on probation pursuant to this section or (ii) following a finding that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of his probation previously ordered, shall place the defendant on probation pursuant to this section. Such probation shall be conditioned upon the defendant's entry into and successful completion of the community corrections alternative program. The court shall order that, upon successful completion of the program, the defendant shall be released from confinement and be under probation supervision for a period of not less than one year. The court shall further order that the defendant, prior to release from confinement, shall (a) make reasonable efforts to secure and maintain employment; (b) comply with a plan of restitution or community service; (c) comply with a plan for payment of fines, if any, and costs of court; and (d) undergo substance abuse treatment, if necessary. The court may impose such other terms and conditions of probation as it deems appropriate to be effective on the defendant's successful completion of the community corrections alternative program. A sentence to the community corrections alternative program shall not be imposed in addition to an active sentence to a state correctional facility.</p><p>4. Upon the defendant's (i) voluntary withdrawal from the community corrections alternative program, (ii) removal from the program by the Department for intractable behavior, or (iii) failure to comply with the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall cause the defendant to show cause why his probation and suspension of sentence should not be revoked. Upon a finding that the defendant voluntarily withdrew from the program, was removed from the program by the Department for intractable behavior, or failed to comply with the terms and conditions of probation, the court may revoke all or part of the probation and suspended sentence and commit the defendant as otherwise provided in this chapter.</p><p>C. Any offender incarcerated for a nonviolent felony paroled under § <a href='/vacode/53.1-155/'>53.1-155</a> or mandatorily released under § <a href='/vacode/53.1-159/'>53.1-159</a> and for whom probable cause that a violation of parole or of the terms and conditions of mandatory release, other than the occurrence of a new felony or Class 1 or Class 2 misdemeanor, has been determined under § <a href='/vacode/53.1-165/'>53.1-165</a>, may be considered by the Parole Board for commitment to a community corrections alternative program as established under § <a href='/vacode/53.1-67.9/'>53.1-67.9</a> as follows:</p><p>1. The Parole Board or its authorized hearing officer, with the violator's consent or upon receipt of a defendant's written voluntary agreement to participate form from the probation and parole officer, may order the violator to be evaluated and diagnosed by the Department of Corrections to determine suitability for participation in the community corrections alternative program. The evaluation and diagnosis may be conducted by the Department at any state or local correctional facility, probation or parole office, or other location deemed appropriate by the Department.</p><p>2. Upon determination that (i) such commitment is in the best interest of the Commonwealth and the violator and (ii) facilities are available for the confinement of the violator, the Department shall recommend to the Parole Board in writing that the violator be committed to the community corrections alternative program. The Department shall have the final authority to determine an individual's eligibility and suitability for the program.</p><p>3. Upon receipt of such a recommendation and a determination by the Parole Board that the violator will benefit from the program and is capable of returning to society as a productive citizen following successful completion of the program and if the violator would otherwise be committed to the Department, the Parole Board shall restore the violator to parole supervision conditioned upon entry into and successful completion of the community corrections alternative program. The Parole Board shall order that, upon successful completion of the program, the violator shall be placed under parole supervision for a period of not less than one year. The Parole Board may impose such other terms and conditions of parole or mandatory release as it deems appropriate to be effective on the defendant's successful completion of the community corrections alternative program. The time spent in the program shall not be counted as service of any part of a term of imprisonment for which he was sentenced upon his conviction.</p><p>4. Upon the violator's (i) voluntary withdrawal from the program, (ii) removal from the program by the Department for intractable behavior, or (iii) failure to comply with the terms and conditions of parole or mandatory release, the Parole Board may revoke parole or mandatory release and recommit the violator as provided in § <a href='/vacode/53.1-165/'>53.1-165</a>.</p><p>D. A person sentenced pursuant to this article who receives payment for employment while in the community corrections alternative program shall be required to pay an amount to be determined by the Department of Corrections to defray the cost of his keep.</p><p>2019, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0618'>618</a>; 2024, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+CHAP0650'>650</a>.</p>"

When, due to the error, neglect, or fault of counsel representing the appellant, or of the court reporter, or of the circuit court or an officer or employee thereof, an appeal, in whole or in part, in a criminal case has (i) never been initiated, (ii) been dismissed for failure to adhere to proper form, procedures, or time limits in the perfection of the appeal, (iii) been dismissed in part because at least one assignment of error did not adhere to proper form of procedures, or (iv) the conviction has been affirmed for failure to file or timely file the indispensable transcript or written statement of facts as required by law or by the Rules of Supreme Court, then a motion for leave to pursue a delayed appeal may be filed in the Court of Appeals within six months after the appeal has been dismissed, the conviction has been affirmed, or the circuit court judgment sought to be appealed has become final, whichever is later. Such motion shall identify the circuit court and the style, date, and circuit court record number of the judgment sought to be appealed, and, if one was assigned in a prior attempt to appeal the judgment, shall give the Court of Appeals record number in that proceeding, and shall set forth the specific facts establishing the said error, neglect, or fault. If the error, neglect, or fault is alleged to be that of an attorney representing the appellant, the motion shall be accompanied by the affidavit of the attorney whose error, neglect, or fault is alleged, verifying the specific facts alleged in the motion, and certifying that the appellant is not personally responsible, in whole or in part, for the error, neglect, or fault causing loss of the original opportunity for appeal.</p><p>B. Service, response, and disposition. Such motion shall be served on the attorney for the Commonwealth and the Attorney General, in accordance with the Rules of Supreme Court. If the Commonwealth disputes the facts alleged in the motion, or contends that those facts do not entitle the appellant to a delayed appeal under this section, the motion shall be denied without prejudice to the appellant's right to seek a delayed appeal by means of petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Otherwise, the Court of Appeals shall, if the motion meets the requirements of this section, grant appellant leave to initiate or re-initiate pursuit of the appeal.</p><p>C. Time limits when motion granted. If the motion is granted, all computations of time under the Rules of Supreme Court shall run from the date of the order of the Court of Appeals granting the motion, or if the appellant has been determined to be indigent, from the date of the order by the circuit court appointing counsel to represent the appellant in the delayed appeal, whichever is later.</p><p>D.

    "Body": "<p>A. Filing and content of motion. When, due to the error, neglect, or fault of counsel representing the appellant, or of the court reporter, or of the Court of Appeals or the circuit court or an officer or employee of either, an appeal from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court in a criminal case has (i) never been initiated, (ii) been dismissed for failure to adhere to proper form, procedures, or time limits in the perfection of the appeal, (iii) been dismissed in part because at least one assignment of error contained in the petition for appeal did not adhere to proper form or procedures, or (iv) been denied or the conviction has been affirmed for failure to file or timely file the indispensable transcript or written statement of facts as required by law or by the Rules of Supreme Court, then a motion for leave to pursue a delayed appeal may be filed in the Supreme Court within six months after the appeal has been dismissed or denied, the conviction has been affirmed, or the Court of Appeals judgment sought to be appealed has become final, whichever is later. Such motion shall identify by the style, date, and Court of Appeals record number of the judgment sought to be appealed, and, if one was assigned in a prior attempt to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court, shall give the record number assigned in the Supreme Court in that proceeding, and shall set forth the specific facts establishing the said error, neglect, or fault. If the error, neglect, or fault is alleged to be that of an attorney representing the appellant, the motion shall be accompanied by the affidavit of the attorney whose error, neglect, or fault is alleged, verifying the specific facts alleged in the motion, and certifying that the appellant is not personally responsible, in whole or in part, for the error, neglect, or fault causing loss of the original opportunity for appeal.</p><p>B. Service, response, and disposition. Such motion shall be served on the attorney for the Commonwealth and the Attorney General, in accordance with Rule 5:4 of the Supreme Court. If the Commonwealth disputes the facts alleged in the motion, or contends that those facts do not entitle the appellant to a delayed appeal under this section, the motion shall be denied without prejudice to the appellant's right to seek a delayed appeal by means of petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Otherwise, the Supreme Court shall, if the motion meets the requirements of this section, grant appellant leave to initiate or re-initiate pursuit of the appeal from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court.</p><p>C. Time limits when motion granted. If the motion is granted, all computations of time under the Rules of Supreme Court shall run from the date of the order of the Supreme Court granting the motion, or if the appellant has been determined to be indigent, from the date of the order by the circuit court appointing counsel to represent the appellant in the delayed appeal, whichever is later.</p><p>D. Applicability. The provisions of this section shall not apply to cases in which the appellant is responsible, in whole or in part, for the error, neglect, or fault causing loss of the original opportunity for appeal, nor shall it apply in cases where the claim of error, neglect, or fault has already been alleged and rejected in a prior judicial proceeding.</p><p>2005, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0836'>836</a>; 2011, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0278'>278</a>; 2017, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0077'>77</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0079'>79</a>; 2021, Sp.

The petitioner shall assert categorically and with specificity, under oath, the facts to support the items enumerated in subsection A and (i) the crime for which the person was convicted or adjudicated delinquent, (ii) the reason or reasons the evidence was not known or tested by the time the conviction or adjudication of delinquency became final in the circuit court, and (iii) the reason or reasons that the newly discovered or untested evidence may prove the actual innocence of the person convicted or adjudicated delinquent. Such motion shall contain all relevant allegations and facts that are known to the petitioner at the time of filing and shall enumerate and include all previous records, applications, petitions, and appeals and their dispositions.</p><p>C.

A laboratory selected by the court that ordered the testing if the Commonwealth and the applicant are unable to agree on a laboratory.</p><p>If the testing is conducted by the Department of Forensic Science, the court shall prescribe in its order, pursuant to standards and guidelines established by the Department, the method of custody, transfer, and return of evidence submitted for scientific investigation sufficient to insure and protect the Commonwealth's interest in the integrity of the evidence. The results of any such testing shall be furnished simultaneously to the court, the petitioner and his attorney of record and the attorney for the Commonwealth. The results of any tests performed and any hearings held pursuant to this section shall become a part of the record.</p><p>If the testing is not conducted by the Department of Forensic Science, it shall be conducted by a laboratory that is accredited by an accrediting body that requires conformance to forensic-specific requirements and that is a signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement with a scope of accreditation that covers the testing being performed and follows the appropriate Quality Assurance Standards issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>F.

If the Court of Appeals does not summarily dismiss the petition, it shall so notify in writing the Attorney General, the attorney for the Commonwealth, and the petitioner. The Attorney General shall have 60 days after receipt of such notice in which to file a response to the petition that may be extended for good cause shown; however, nothing shall prevent the Attorney General from filing an earlier response.

The burden of proof in a proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter shall be upon the convicted or delinquent person seeking relief.

Such guidelines shall not supersede contracts between attorneys for the Commonwealth and private attorneys and collection agencies when active collection efforts are being undertaken.

Any defendant convicted of a traffic infraction or a violation of any criminal law of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof, or found not innocent in the case of a juvenile, who is sentenced to pay a fine, restitution, forfeiture, or penalty may pay such fine, restitution, forfeiture, or penalty and any costs that the defendant may be required to pay in deferred payments or installments. The court assessing the fine, restitution, forfeiture, or penalty and costs shall authorize the clerk to establish and approve individual deferred or installment payment agreements. If the defendant owes court-ordered restitution and enters into a deferred or installment payment agreement, any moneys collected pursuant to such agreement shall be used first to satisfy such restitution order and any collection costs associated with restitution prior to being used to satisfy any other fine, forfeiture, penalty, or cost owed, unless an order for restitution is docketed in the name of the victim or it is ordered that an assignment of the judgment to the victim be docketed. Any payment agreement authorized under this section shall be consistent with the provisions of § <a href='/vacode/19.2-354.1/'>19.2-354.1</a>. The requirements set forth in § <a href='/vacode/19.2-354.1/'>19.2-354.1</a> shall be posted in the clerk's office and on the court's website, if a website is available. As a condition of every such agreement, a defendant who enters into an installment or deferred payment agreement shall promptly inform the court of any change of mailing address during the term of the agreement. If the defendant is unable to make payment within 90 days of sentencing, the court may assess a one-time fee not to exceed $10 to cover the costs of management of the defendant's account until such account is paid in full. This one-time fee shall not apply to cases in which costs are assessed pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/17.1-275.1/'>17.1-275.1</a>, <a href='/vacode/17.1-275.2/'>17.1-275.2</a>, <a href='/vacode/17.1-275.3/'>17.1-275.3</a>, <a href='/vacode/17.1-275.4/'>17.1-275.4</a>, <a href='/vacode/17.1-275.7/'>17.1-275.7</a>, <a href='/vacode/17.1-275.8/'>17.1-275.8</a>, or <a href='/vacode/17.1-275.9/'>17.1-275.9</a>. Installment or deferred payment agreements shall include terms for payment if the defendant participates in a program as provided in subsection B or C. The court, if such sum or sums are not paid in full by the date ordered, shall proceed in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/19.2-358/'>19.2-358</a>.</p><p>B. When a person sentenced to the Department of Corrections or a local correctional facility owes any fines, costs, forfeitures, restitution, or penalties, he shall be required as a condition of participating in any work release, home/electronic incarceration, or nonconsecutive days program as set forth in § <a href='/vacode/53.1-60/'>53.1-60</a>, <a href='/vacode/53.1-131/'>53.1-131</a>, <a href='/vacode/53.1-131.1/'>53.1-131.1</a>, or <a href='/vacode/53.1-131.2/'>53.1-131.2</a> to either make full payment or make payments in accordance with his installment or deferred payment agreement while participating in such program. If, after the person has an installment or deferred payment agreement, the person fails to pay as ordered, his participation in the program may be terminated until all fines, costs, forfeitures, restitution, and penalties are satisfied. The Director of the Department of Corrections and any sheriff or other administrative head of any local correctional facility shall withhold such ordered payments from any amounts due to such person. Distribution of the moneys collected shall be made in the following order of priority to:</p><p>1. Meet the obligation of any judicial or administrative order to provide support and such funds shall be disbursed according to the terms of such order;</p><p>2.

    "Section": "19.2-354.1",
    "Title": "Deferred or installment payment agreements",
    "Body": "<p>A. For purposes of this section:</p><p>\"Deferred payment agreement\" means an agreement in which no installment payments are required and the defendant agrees to pay the full amount of the fines and costs at the end of the agreement's stated term.</p><p>\"Fines and costs\" means all fines, court costs, forfeitures, and penalties assessed in any case by a single court against a defendant for the commission of any crime or traffic infraction. \"Fines and costs\" includes restitution unless the court orders a separate payment schedule for restitution.</p><p>\"Installment payment agreement\" means an agreement in which the defendant agrees to make monthly or other periodic payments until the fines and costs are paid in full.</p><p>\"Modified deferred payment agreement\" means a deferred payment agreement in which the defendant also agrees to use best efforts to make monthly or other periodic payments.</p><p>B. The court shall give a defendant ordered to pay fines and costs written notice of the availability of deferred, modified deferred, and installment payment agreements and, if a community service program has been established, the availability of earning credit toward discharge of fines and costs through the performance of community service work. The court shall offer any defendant the opportunity to enter into a deferred payment agreement, modified deferred payment agreement, or installment payment agreement.</p><p>C. The court shall not deny a defendant the opportunity to enter into a deferred, modified deferred, or installment payment agreement solely (i) because of the category of offense for which the defendant was convicted or found not innocent, (ii) because of the total amount of all fines and costs, (iii) because the defendant previously defaulted under the terms of a payment agreement, (iv) because the fines and costs have been referred for collections pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-349/'>19.2-349</a>, or (v) because the defendant has not established a payment history.</p><p>D. In determining the length of time to pay under a deferred, modified deferred, or installment payment agreement and the amount of the payments, a court shall take into account the defendant's financial resources and obligations, including any fines and costs owed by the defendant in other courts. In assessing the defendant's ability to pay, the court shall use a written financial statement, on a form developed by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court, setting forth the defendant's financial resources and obligations or conduct an oral examination of the defendant to determine his financial resources and obligations. The length of a payment agreement and the amount of the payments shall be reasonable in light of the defendant's financial resources and obligations and shall not be based solely on the amount of fines and costs. The court may offer a payment agreement combining an initial period during which no payment of fines and costs is required followed by a period of installment payments.</p><p>E. No court shall require a defendant to make a down payment upon entering a deferred, modified deferred, or installment payment agreement, other than a subsequent payment agreement, in which case the court may require a down payment pursuant to subsection I. Nothing in this section shall prevent a defendant from voluntarily making a down payment upon entering any payment agreement.</p><p>F. All fines and costs that a defendant owes for all cases in any single court may be incorporated into one payment agreement, unless otherwise ordered by the court in specific cases. A payment agreement shall include only those outstanding fines and costs for which the limitations period set forth in § <a href='/vacode/19.2-341/'>19.2-341</a> has not run.</p><p>G. Any payment received within 10 days of its due date shall be considered to be timely made.</p><p>H. At any time during the duration of a payment agreement, the defendant may request a modification of the agreement in writing on a form provided by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court, and the court may grant such modification based on a good faith showing of need.</p><p>I. A defendant who has defaulted on a payment agreement may petition the court for a subsequent payment agreement. In determining whether to approve the request for a subsequent payment agreement, the court shall consider any change in the defendant's circumstances. A court may require a down payment to enter into a subsequent payment agreement, provided that the down payment required to enter into a subsequent payment agreement shall not exceed (i) if the fines and costs owed are $500 or less, 10 percent of such amount or (ii) if the fines and costs owed are more than $500, five percent of such amount or $50, whichever is greater. When a defendant enters into a subsequent payment agreement, a court shall not require a defendant to establish a payment history on the subsequent payment agreement before restoring the defendant's driver's license.</p><p>J. In any case in which a defendant owes fines and costs and where such defendant's sole financial resource is a Social Security benefit or Supplemental Security Income, then such defendant shall be exempt from making payments at least until such time that such defendant has a resource other than a Social Security benefit or Supplemental Security Income. If such defendant informs the court that his sole financial resource is a Social Security benefit or Supplemental Security Income, the case shall not be referred to collections pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-349/'>19.2-349</a>. Courts shall include in payment plan policies developed in accordance with §§ <a href='/vacode/19.2-354/'>19.2-354</a> and <a href='/vacode/19.2-354.1/'>19.2-354.1</a> that where the court is informed that a defendant receives a Social Security benefit or Supplemental Security Income, no payment toward fines and costs shall be taken from such exempt resource.</p><p>No Social Security benefit or Supplemental Security Income shall be considered an available resource in determining the length of time to pay under a deferred, modified deferred, or installment payment agreement and the amount of payments, if any, pursuant to subsection D.</p><p>2017, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0802'>802</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0806'>806</a>; 2020, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0964'>964</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0965'>965</a>; 2021, Sp.

    "Body": "<p>A. When an individual obligated to pay a fine, costs, forfeiture, or penalty defaults in the payment or any installment payment, the court upon the motion of the Commonwealth in the case of a conviction of a violation of a state law, or attorney for a locality or for the Commonwealth in the event of a conviction of a violation of a local law or ordinance, or upon its own motion, may require him to show cause why he should not be confined in jail or fined for nonpayment. A show cause proceeding shall not be required prior to issuance of a capias if an order to appear on a date certain in the event of nonpayment was issued pursuant to subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/19.2-354/'>19.2-354</a> and the defendant failed to appear.</p><p>B. Following the order to show cause or following a capias issued for a defendant's failure to comply with a court order to appear issued pursuant to subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/19.2-354/'>19.2-354</a>, unless the defendant shows that his default for the payment of fines, costs, forfeitures, or penalties was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the sentence of the court, or not attributable to a failure on his part to make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary funds for payment, or unless the defendant shows that any failure to appear was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court, the court may order the defendant confined as for a contempt for a term not to exceed sixty days or impose a fine not to exceed $500. The court may provide in its order that payment or satisfaction of the amounts in default for the payment of fines, costs, forfeitures, or penalties at any time will entitle the defendant to his release from such confinement or, after entering the order, may at any time reduce the sentence for good cause shown, including payment or satisfaction of such amounts.</p><p>C. If it appears that the default for the payment of fines, costs, forfeitures, or penalties is excusable under the standards set forth in subsection B, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount due or of each installment, or remitting the unpaid portion in whole or in part.</p><p>D. When an individual obligated to pay restitution defaults in the payment or any installment payment, the court upon the motion of the Commonwealth in the case of a conviction of a violation of a state law, or attorney for a locality or for the Commonwealth in the event of a conviction of a violation of a local law or ordinance, or upon its own motion, may proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection E.</p><p>E. If, pursuant to subsection D or at a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection F of § <a href='/vacode/19.2-305.1/'>19.2-305.1</a>, the court finds that a defendant is not in compliance with a restitution order, the court may order the defendant confined as for a contempt for a term not to exceed 60 days unless the defendant shows that his default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the sentence of the court, or not attributable to a failure on his part to make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary funds for payment, or unless the defendant shows that any failure to appear was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court. The court may provide in its order that payment or satisfaction of the amounts in default at any time will entitle the defendant to his release from such confinement or, after entering the order, may at any time reduce the sentence for good cause shown, including payment or satisfaction of such amounts. If it appears that the defendant's default for the payment of restitution is excusable under the standards set forth in this subsection, the court may modify the terms for payment of restitution, except that the court may not modify the amount of restitution owed by the defendant.</p><p>F.

However, (i) in cases involving claims made on behalf of a minor or a person who is incapacitated, the provisions of subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/8.01-229/'>8.01-229</a> shall apply to toll the one-year period; (ii) in cases involving claims made by a victim against profits of crime held in escrow pursuant to Chapter 21.2 (§ <a href='/vacode/19.2-368.19/'>19.2-368.19</a> et seq.) of this title, the claim shall be filed within five years of the date of the special order of escrow; and (iii) in cases involving claims of sexual abuse of a minor, the claim shall be filed within 10 years after the minor's eighteenth birthday, except for in cases involving claims of sexual abuse of a minor where the conduct constitutes a felony, the passage of time shall not be a barrier to when the victim can file a claim. For good cause shown, the Commission may extend the time for filing for a crime committed on or after July 1, 2001.</p><p>In the case of a crime committed on or after July 1, 1977, and before July 1, 2001, for which a claim was not filed in a timely manner, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing if the attorney for the Commonwealth sends written notification to the Commission that the crime is being investigated as a result of newly discovered evidence. For any claim filed pursuant to this paragraph, the Commission shall only consider expenses and loss of earnings that the claimant accrues after the date of newly discovered evidence as stipulated in the written notification by the attorney for the Commonwealth.</p><p>C. Claims shall be filed in the office of the Commission in person, by mail, or by electronic means in accordance with standards approved by the Commission. The Commission shall accept for filing all claims submitted by persons eligible under subsection A of this section and alleging the jurisdictional requirements set forth in this chapter and meeting the requirements as to form in the rules and regulations of the Commission.</p><p>D. Upon filing of a claim pursuant to this chapter, the Commission shall promptly notify the attorney for the Commonwealth of the jurisdiction wherein the crime is alleged to have occurred. If, within 10 days after such notification, the attorney for the Commonwealth so notified advises the Commission that a criminal prosecution is pending upon the same alleged crime, the Commission shall defer all proceedings under this chapter until such time as such criminal prosecution has been concluded in the circuit court unless notification is received from the attorney for the Commonwealth that no objection is made to a continuation of the investigation and determination of the claim. When such criminal prosecution has been concluded in the circuit court the attorney for the Commonwealth shall promptly so notify the Commission. Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that the Commission is to defer proceedings upon the filing of an appeal, nor shall this section be construed to limit the authority of the Commission to grant emergency awards as hereinafter provided. Upon awarding a claim pursuant to this chapter, the Commission shall promptly notify the attorney for the Commonwealth of the jurisdiction wherein the crime is alleged to have occurred. If a criminal prosecution occurs regarding the same alleged crime, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall request the court to order restitution. However, neither the lack of a restitution order, nor the failure of the attorney for the Commonwealth to request such an order, shall preclude the Fund from exercising its subrogation rights pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-368.15/'>19.2-368.15</a>. Any such restitution shall be paid over to the Comptroller for deposit into the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund to the extent of the amount of the award paid from the Fund.</p><p>1976, c. 605; 1977, c. 215; 1978, c. 122; 1986, c. 457; 1992, c. 681; 1997, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?971+ful+CHAP0801'>801</a>; 1998, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?981+ful+CHAP0484'>484</a>; 2001, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0363'>363</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0855'>855</a>; 2002, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0665'>665</a>; 2005, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+CHAP0683'>683</a>; 2006, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+ful+CHAP0414'>414</a>; 2009, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0381'>381</a>; 2014, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0251'>251</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+CHAP0665'>665</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0456'>456</a>; 2024, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+CHAP0175'>175</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+CHAP0254'>254</a>.</p>"

If no such finding is made by the court, all property seized shall be released from seizure no later than 21 days from the date the stay terminates. However, property that has been seized may be forfeited pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter even though no finding of guilt is made if (i) such forfeiture is ordered by a court pursuant to a lawful plea agreement or (ii) the owner of the property or the person in whose custody the property was found has not submitted a written demand for the return of the property with the law-enforcement agency that seized the property within 21 days from the date the stay terminates.</p><p>1989, c. 690; 1991, c. 560; 2002, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0588'>588</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+CHAP0623'>623</a>; 2004, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?041+ful+CHAP0995'>995</a>; 2012, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0283'>283</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+CHAP0756'>756</a>; 2020, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1000'>1000</a>.</p>"

All cash, negotiable instruments and proceeds from a sale conducted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-386.7/'>19.2-386.7</a> or <a href='/vacode/19.2-386.12/'>19.2-386.12</a>, after deduction of expenses, fees and costs as provided in § <a href='/vacode/19.2-386.12/'>19.2-386.12</a>, shall, as soon after entry of the forfeiture as is practicable, be paid over to the state treasury into a special fund of the Department of Criminal Justice Services for distribution in accordance with this section. The forfeited property and proceeds, less 10 percent, shall be made available to federal, state, and local agencies to promote law enforcement in accordance with this section, which may include expenditures to strengthen relationships between the community and law enforcement, encourage goodwill between the community and law enforcement, or promote cooperation with law enforcement, and regulations adopted by the Criminal Justice Services Board to implement the asset-sharing program.</p><p>The 10 percent retained by the Department shall be held in a nonreverting fund, known as the Asset Sharing Administrative Fund. Administrative costs incurred by the Department to manage and operate the asset-sharing program shall be paid from the Fund. Any amounts remaining in the Fund after payment of these costs shall be used to promote state or local law-enforcement activities. Distributions from the Fund for these activities shall be based upon need and shall be made from time to time in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Board.</p><p>B. Any federal, state or local agency or office that directly participated in the investigation or other law-enforcement activity which led, directly or indirectly, to the seizure and forfeiture shall be eligible for, and may petition the Department for, return of the forfeited asset or an equitable share of the net proceeds, based upon the degree of participation in the law-enforcement effort resulting in the forfeiture, taking into account the total value of all property forfeited and the total law-enforcement effort with respect to the violation of law on which the forfeiture is based. Upon finding that the petitioning agency is eligible for distribution and that all participating agencies agree on the equitable share of each, the Department shall distribute each share directly to the appropriate treasury of the participating agency.</p><p>If all eligible participating agencies cannot agree on the equitable shares of the net proceeds, the shares shall be determined by the Criminal Justice Services Board in accordance with regulations which shall specify the criteria to be used by the Board in assessing the degree of participation in the law-enforcement effort resulting in the forfeiture.</p><p>C. After the order of forfeiture is entered concerning any motor vehicle, boat, aircraft, or other tangible personal property, any seizing agency may (i) petition the Department for return of the property that is not subject to a grant or pending petition for remission or (ii) request the circuit court to order the property destroyed. Where all the participating agencies agree upon the equitable distribution of the tangible personal property, the Department shall return the property to those agencies upon finding that (a) the agency meets the criteria for distribution as set forth in subsection B and (b) the agency has a clear and reasonable law-enforcement need for the forfeited property.</p><p>If all eligible participating agencies cannot agree on the distribution of the property, distribution shall be determined by the Criminal Justice Services Board as in subsection B, taking into consideration the clear and reasonable law-enforcement needs for the property which the agencies may have. In order to equitably distribute tangible personal property, the Criminal Justice Services Board may require the agency receiving the property to reimburse the Department in cash for the difference between the fair market value of the forfeited property and the agency's equitable share as determined by the Criminal Justice Services Board.</p><p>If a seizing agency has received property for its use pursuant to this section, when the agency disposes of the property (1) by sale, the proceeds shall be distributed as set forth in this section; or (2) by destruction pursuant to a court order, the agency shall do so in a manner consistent with this section.</p><p>D. All forfeited property, including its proceeds or cash equivalent, received by a participating state or local agency pursuant to this section shall be used to promote law enforcement, which may include expenditures to strengthen relationships between the community and law enforcement, encourage goodwill between the community and law enforcement, or promote cooperation with law enforcement, but shall not be used to supplant existing programs or funds. The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing an audit procedure to ensure compliance with this section.</p><p>E. On or after July 1, 2012, but before July 1, 2014, local seizing agencies may contribute cash funds and proceeds from forfeited property to the Virginia Public Safety Foundation to support the construction of the Commonwealth Public Safety Memorial. Any funds contributed by seizing agencies shall be contributed only after an internal analysis to determine that such contributions will not negatively impact law-enforcement training or operations.</p><p>F. The Department shall report annually on or before December 31 to the Governor and the General Assembly the amount of all cash, negotiable instruments, and proceeds from sales conducted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-386.7/'>19.2-386.7</a> or <a href='/vacode/19.2-386.12/'>19.2-386.12</a> that were forfeited to the Commonwealth, including the amount of all forfeitures distributed to the Literary Fund. Such report shall also detail the amount distributed by the Department to each federal, state, or local agency or office pursuant to this section, and the amount each state or local agency or office received from federal asset forfeiture proceedings. Any state or local agency that receives a forfeited asset or an equitable share of the net proceeds of a forfeited asset from the Department or from a federal asset forfeiture proceeding shall inform the Department, in a manner prescribed by the Department, of (i) the offense on which the forfeiture is based listed in the information filed pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-386.1/'>19.2-386.1</a>, (ii) any criminal charge brought against the owner of the forfeited asset, and (iii) if a criminal charge was brought against the owner of the forfeited asset, the status of the charge, including whether the charge is pending or resulted in a conviction. The Department shall include such information in the annual report.

A qualified entity may request the Department of State Police to conduct a national criminal background check on any provider who is employed by such entity. No qualified entity may request a national criminal background check on a provider until such provider has:</p><p>1. Been fingerprinted; and</p><p>2. Completed and signed a statement, furnished by the entity, that includes (i) his name, address, and date of birth as it appears on a valid identification document; (ii) a disclosure of whether or not the provider has ever been convicted of or is the subject of pending charges for a criminal offense within or outside the Commonwealth, and if the provider has been convicted of a crime, a description of the crime and the particulars of the conviction; (iii) a notice to the provider that the entity may request a background check; (iv) a notice to the provider that he is entitled to obtain a copy of any background check report, to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in any such report, and to obtain a prompt determination as to the validity of such challenge before a final determination is made by the Department; and (v) a notice to the provider that prior to the completion of the background check the qualified entity may choose to deny the provider unsupervised access to children or the elderly or disabled for whom the qualified entity provides care.</p><p>C. Upon receipt of (i) a qualified entity's written request to conduct a background check on a provider, (ii) the provider's fingerprints, and (iii) a completed, signed statement as described in subsection B, the Department shall make a determination whether the provider has been convicted of or is the subject of charges of a barrier crime. To conduct its determination regarding the provider's barrier crime information, the Department shall access the national criminal history background check system, which is maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is based on fingerprints and other methods of identification, and shall access the Central Criminal Records Exchange maintained by the Department. If the Department receives a background report lacking disposition data, the Department shall conduct research in whatever state and local recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data. The Department shall make reasonable efforts to respond to a qualified entity's inquiry within 15 business days.</p><p>D. Any background check conducted pursuant to this section for a provider employed by a private entity shall be screened by the Department of State Police.

    "Title": "(Effective until date pursuant to Acts 2023, cc. 554 and 555, cl. 4) Expungement of police and court records",
    "Body": "<p>A. If a person is charged with the commission of a crime, a civil offense, or any offense defined in Title 18.2, and</p><p>1. Is acquitted, or</p><p>2. A nolle prosequi is taken or the charge is otherwise dismissed, including dismissal by accord and satisfaction pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-151/'>19.2-151</a>, he may file a petition setting forth the relevant facts and requesting expungement of the police records and the court records relating to the charge.</p><p>B. If any person whose name or other identification has been used without his consent or authorization by another person who has been charged or arrested using such name or identification, he may file a petition with the court disposing of the charge for relief pursuant to this section. Such person shall not be required to pay any fees for the filing of a petition under this subsection. A petition filed under this subsection shall include one complete set of the petitioner's fingerprints obtained from a law-enforcement agency.</p><p>C. The petition with a copy of the warrant, summons, or indictment if reasonably available shall be filed in the circuit court of the county or city in which the case was disposed of by acquittal or being otherwise dismissed and shall contain, except where not reasonably available, the date of arrest and the name of the arresting agency. Where this information is not reasonably available, the petition shall state the reason for such unavailability. The petition shall further state the specific criminal charge or civil offense to be expunged, the date of final disposition of the charge as set forth in the petition, the petitioner's date of birth, and the full name used by the petitioner at the time of arrest.</p><p>D. A copy of the petition shall be served on the attorney for the Commonwealth of the city or county in which the petition is filed. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file an objection or answer to the petition or may give written notice to the court that he does not object to the petition within 21 days after it is served on him.</p><p>E. The petitioner shall obtain from a law-enforcement agency one complete set of the petitioner's fingerprints and shall provide that agency with a copy of the petition for expungement. The law-enforcement agency shall submit the set of fingerprints to the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) with a copy of the petition for expungement attached. The CCRE shall forward under seal to the court a copy of the petitioner's criminal history, a copy of the source documents that resulted in the CCRE entry that the petitioner wishes to expunge, if applicable, and the set of fingerprints. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall return the fingerprint card to the petitioner. If no hearing was conducted, upon the entry of an order of expungement or an order denying the petition for expungement, the court shall cause the fingerprint card to be destroyed unless, within 30 days of the date of the entry of the order, the petitioner requests the return of the fingerprint card in person from the clerk of the court or provides the clerk of the court a self-addressed, stamped envelope for the return of the fingerprint card.</p><p>F. After receiving the criminal history record information from the CCRE, the court shall conduct a hearing on the petition. If the court finds that the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the arrest of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances which constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, it shall enter an order requiring the expungement of the police and court records, including electronic records, relating to the charge. Otherwise, it shall deny the petition. However, if the petitioner has no prior criminal record and the arrest was for a misdemeanor violation or the charge was for a civil offense, the petitioner shall be entitled, in the absence of good cause shown to the contrary by the Commonwealth, to expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge, and the court shall enter an order of expungement. If the attorney for the Commonwealth of the county or city in which the petition is filed (i) gives written notice to the court pursuant to subsection D that he does not object to the petition and (ii) when the charge to be expunged is a felony, stipulates in such written notice that the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the arrest of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances which constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, the court may enter an order of expungement without conducting a hearing.</p><p>G. The Commonwealth shall be made party defendant to the proceeding. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the court may appeal, as provided by law in civil cases.</p><p>H. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when the charge is dismissed because the court finds that the person arrested or charged is not the person named in the summons, warrant, indictment or presentment, the court dismissing the charge shall, upon motion of the person improperly arrested or charged, enter an order requiring expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge. Such order shall contain a statement that the dismissal and expungement are ordered pursuant to this subsection and shall be accompanied by the complete set of the petitioner's fingerprints filed with his petition. Upon the entry of such order, it shall be treated as provided in subsection K.</p><p>I. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, upon receiving a copy pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/2.2-402/'>2.2-402</a> of an absolute pardon for the commission of a crime that a person did not commit, the court shall enter an order requiring expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge and conviction. Such order shall contain a statement that the expungement is ordered pursuant to this subsection. Upon the entry of such order, it shall be treated as provided in subsection K.</p><p>J. Upon receiving a copy of a writ vacating a conviction pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-327.5/'>19.2-327.5</a> or <a href='/vacode/19.2-327.13/'>19.2-327.13</a>, the court shall enter an order requiring expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge and conviction. Such order shall contain a statement that the expungement is ordered pursuant to this subsection. Upon the entry of the order, it shall be treated as provided in subsection K.</p><p>K. Upon the entry of an order of expungement, the clerk of the court shall cause a copy of such order to be forwarded to the Department of State Police, which shall, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-134/'>9.1-134</a>, direct the manner by which the appropriate expungement or removal of such records shall be effected.</p><p>L.

    "Body": "<p>A. If a person is charged with the commission of a crime, a civil offense, or any offense defined in Title 18.2, and</p><p>1. Is acquitted, or</p><p>2. A nolle prosequi is taken or the charge is otherwise dismissed, including dismissal by accord and satisfaction pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-151/'>19.2-151</a>, he may file a petition setting forth the relevant facts and requesting expungement of the police records and the court records relating to the charge.</p><p>B. If any person whose name or other identification has been used without his consent or authorization by another person who has been charged or arrested using such name or identification, he may file a petition with the court disposing of the charge for relief pursuant to this section. Such person shall not be required to pay any fees for the filing of a petition under this subsection. A petition filed under this subsection shall include one complete set of the petitioner's fingerprints obtained from a law-enforcement agency.</p><p>C. The petition with a copy of the warrant, summons, or indictment if reasonably available shall be filed in the circuit court of the county or city in which the case was disposed of by acquittal or being otherwise dismissed and shall contain, except when not reasonably available, the date of arrest and the name of the arresting agency. When this information is not reasonably available, the petition shall state the reason for such unavailability. The petition shall further state the specific criminal charge or civil offense to be expunged, the date of final disposition of the charge as set forth in the petition, the petitioner's date of birth, and the full name used by the petitioner at the time of arrest. If the petition is filed under this subsection, the petitioner shall request that the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) electronically forward a copy of the petitioner's Virginia criminal history record to the circuit court in which the petition was filed. Upon receiving such request, the CCRE shall electronically forward such record to the circuit court; however, if the circuit court is unable to receive an electronic transmission, the CCRE shall forward a copy of such record to the circuit court which shall be maintained under seal by the clerk unless otherwise ordered by the court.</p><p>D. A copy of the petition shall be served on the attorney for the Commonwealth of the city or county in which the petition is filed. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file an objection or answer to the petition or may give written notice to the court that he does not object to the petition within 21 days after it is served on him.</p><p>E. If the petition is filed under subsection B, the petitioner shall obtain from a law-enforcement agency one complete set of the petitioner's fingerprints and shall provide that agency with a copy of the petition for expungement. The law-enforcement agency shall submit the set of fingerprints to the CCRE with a copy of the petition for expungement attached. The CCRE shall forward under seal to the court a copy of the petitioner's criminal history and the set of fingerprints. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall return the fingerprint card to the petitioner. If no hearing was conducted, upon the entry of an order of expungement or an order denying the petition for expungement, the court shall cause the fingerprint card to be destroyed unless, within 30 days of the date of the entry of the order, the petitioner requests the return of the fingerprint card in person from the clerk of the court or provides the clerk of the court a self-addressed, stamped envelope for the return of the fingerprint card.</p><p>F. After receiving the criminal history record information, the court shall conduct a hearing on the petition. If the court finds that the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the arrest of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances which constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, it shall enter an order requiring the expungement of the police and court records, including electronic records, relating to the charge. Otherwise, it shall deny the petition. However, if the petitioner has no prior criminal record and the arrest was for a misdemeanor violation or the charge was for a civil offense, the petitioner shall be entitled, in the absence of good cause shown to the contrary by the Commonwealth, to expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge, and the court shall enter an order of expungement. If the attorney for the Commonwealth of the county or city in which the petition is filed (i) gives written notice to the court pursuant to subsection D that he does not object to the petition and (ii) when the charge to be expunged is a felony, stipulates in such written notice that the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the arrest of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances which constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, the court may enter an order of expungement without conducting a hearing.</p><p>G. The Commonwealth shall be made party defendant to the proceeding. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the court may appeal, as provided by law in civil cases.</p><p>H. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when the charge is dismissed because the court finds that the person arrested or charged is not the person named in the summons, warrant, indictment or presentment, the court dismissing the charge shall, upon motion of the person improperly arrested or charged, enter an order requiring expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge. Such order shall contain a statement that the dismissal and expungement are ordered pursuant to this subsection and shall be accompanied by the complete set of the petitioner's fingerprints filed with his petition. Upon the entry of such order, it shall be treated as provided in subsection K.</p><p>I. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, upon receiving a copy pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/2.2-402/'>2.2-402</a> of an absolute pardon for the commission of a crime that a person did not commit, the court shall enter an order requiring expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge and conviction. Such order shall contain a statement that the expungement is ordered pursuant to this subsection. Upon the entry of such order, it shall be treated as provided in subsection K.</p><p>J. Upon receiving a copy of a writ vacating a conviction pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-327.5/'>19.2-327.5</a> or <a href='/vacode/19.2-327.13/'>19.2-327.13</a>, the court shall enter an order requiring expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge and conviction. Such order shall contain a statement that the expungement is ordered pursuant to this subsection. Upon the entry of the order, it shall be treated as provided in subsection K.</p><p>K. Upon the entry of an order of expungement, the clerk of the court shall cause a copy of such order to be forwarded to the Department of State Police, which shall, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-134/'>9.1-134</a>, direct the manner by which the appropriate expungement or removal of such records shall be effected.</p><p>L. Costs shall be as provided by § <a href='/vacode/17.1-275/'>17.1-275</a>, but shall not be recoverable against the Commonwealth. If the court enters an order of expungement, the clerk of the court shall refund to the petitioner such costs paid by the petitioner.</p><p>M. Any order entered where (i) the court or parties failed to strictly comply with the procedures set forth in this section or (ii) the court enters an order of expungement contrary to law, shall be voidable upon motion and notice made within three years of the entry of such order.</p><p>N. A petition filed under this section and any responsive pleadings filed by the attorney for the Commonwealth shall be maintained under seal by the clerk unless otherwise ordered by the court. Any order to expunge issued pursuant to this section shall be sealed and may only be disseminated for the purposes set forth in § <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.3/'>19.2-392.3</a> pursuant to regulations and procedures adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-128/'>9.1-128</a> and procedures adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-134/'>9.1-134</a>.</p><p>1977, c. 675; 1983, c. 394; 1984, c. 642; 1990, c. 603; 1992, c. 697; 2001, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0040'>40</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?011+ful+CHAP0345'>345</a>; 2007, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0465'>465</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0824'>824</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0883'>883</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+CHAP0905'>905</a>; 2009, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0618'>618</a>; 2011, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+ful+CHAP0362'>362</a>; 2015, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+CHAP0426'>426</a>; 2016, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+CHAP0617'>617</a>; 2019, c. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0181'>181</a>; 2020, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1285'>1285</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1286'>1286</a>; 2023, cc. <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+CHAP0554'>554</a>, <a href='http://LegacyLIS.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+CHAP0555'>555</a>.</p>"

    "Body": "<p>A. Except for a conviction or deferral and dismissal of a violation of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-36.1/'>18.2-36.1</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-36.2/'>18.2-36.2</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-51.4/'>18.2-51.4</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-51.5/'>18.2-51.5</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-57.2/'>18.2-57.2</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-266/'>18.2-266</a>, or <a href='/vacode/46.2-341.24/'>46.2-341.24</a>, a person who has been convicted of or had a charge deferred and dismissed for a (i) misdemeanor offense, (ii) Class 5 or 6 felony, or (iii) violation of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-95/'>18.2-95</a> or any other felony offense in which the defendant is deemed guilty of larceny and punished as provided in § <a href='/vacode/18.2-95/'>18.2-95</a> may file a petition setting forth the relevant facts and requesting sealing of the criminal history record information and court records relating to the charge or conviction, provided that such person has (a) never been convicted of a Class 1 or 2 felony or any other felony punishable by imprisonment for life, (b) not been convicted of a Class 3 or 4 felony within the past 20 years, and (c) not been convicted of any other felony within the past 10 years of his petition.</p><p>B. A person shall not be required to pay any fees or costs for filing a petition pursuant to this section if such person files a petition to proceed without the payment of fees and costs, and the court with which such person files his petition finds such person to be indigent pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-159/'>19.2-159</a>.</p><p>C. The petition with a copy of the warrant, summons, or indictment, if reasonably available, shall be filed in the circuit court of the county or city in which the case was disposed of and shall contain, except when not reasonably available, the date of arrest, the name of the arresting agency, and the date of conviction. When this information is not reasonably available, the petition shall state the reason for such unavailability. The petition shall further state the charge or conviction to be sealed; the date of final disposition of the charge or conviction as set forth in the petition; the petitioner's date of birth, sex, race, and social security number, if available; and the full name used by the petitioner at the time of arrest or summons. A petition may request the sealing of the criminal history record information and court records for multiple charges or convictions as set forth in subsection A provided that all such charges and convictions arose out of the same transaction or occurrence and all such charges are eligible for sealing. A petition may not request the sealing of the criminal history record information and court records for multiple charges or convictions that arose out of different transactions or occurrences. A petitioner may only have two petitions granted pursuant to this section within his lifetime. Any petition that is granted (i) solely to seal a violation of subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-265.3/'>18.2-265.3</a> as it relates to marijuana, (ii) solely to seal a violation of § <a href='/vacode/4.1-305/'>4.1-305</a>, or (iii) to seal a violation of both subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-265.3/'>18.2-265.3</a> as it relates to marijuana and § <a href='/vacode/4.1-305/'>4.1-305</a> arising out of the same transaction or occurrence shall not count against the petitioner's lifetime maximum.</p><p>D. The Commonwealth shall be made party to the proceeding. The petitioner shall provide a copy of the petition by delivery or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the attorney for the Commonwealth of the city or county in which the petition is filed. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file an objection or answer to the petition or may give written notice to the court that he does not object to the petition within 21 days after it is delivered to him or received in the mail.</p><p>E. In addition to the filing of the petition under subsection C, the petitioner shall request that the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) electronically forward a copy of the petitioner's Virginia criminal history record to the circuit court in which the petition was filed. Upon receiving such request, the CCRE shall electronically forward such record to the circuit court; however, if the circuit court is unable to receive an electronic transmission, the CCRE shall forward a copy of such record to the circuit court which shall be maintained under seal by the clerk unless otherwise ordered by the court. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall cause the criminal history record to be destroyed unless, within 30 days of the date of the entry of the final order in the matter, the petitioner or the attorney for the Commonwealth notes an appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p><p>F. After receiving the criminal history record of the petitioner, the court may conduct a hearing on the petition. The court shall enter an order requiring the sealing of the criminal history record information and court records, including electronic records, relating to the charge or conviction, only if the court finds that all criteria in subdivisions 1 through 4 are met, as follows:</p><p>1. During a period after the date of (i) dismissal of a deferred charge, (ii) conviction, or (iii) release from incarceration of the charge or conviction set forth in the petition, whichever date occurred later, the person has not been convicted of violating any law of the Commonwealth that requires a report to the Central Criminal Records Exchange under subsection A of § <a href='/vacode/19.2-390/'>19.2-390</a> or any other state, the District of Columbia, or the United States or any territory thereof, excluding traffic infractions under Title 46.2, for:</p><p>a. Seven years for any misdemeanor offense; or</p><p>b. Ten years for any felony offense;</p><p>2. If the records relating to the offense indicate that the occurrence leading to the deferral or conviction involved the use or dependence upon alcohol or any narcotic drug or any other self-administered intoxicant or drug of whatsoever nature, the petitioner has demonstrated his rehabilitation;</p><p>3. The petitioner has not previously obtained the sealing of two other deferrals or convictions arising out of different sentencing events; and</p><p>4. The continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the charge or conviction of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances that constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner.</p><p>G. If the attorney for the Commonwealth of the county or city in which the petition is filed (i) gives written notice to the court pursuant to subsection D that he does not object to the petition and (ii) stipulates in such written notice that the petitioner is eligible to have such offense sealed, and the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the charge or conviction of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances that constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, the court may enter an order of sealing without conducting a hearing.</p><p>H. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the court may appeal, as provided by law in civil cases.</p><p>I. Upon the entry of an order of sealing, the clerk of the court shall maintain a copy of such order under seal and shall cause an electronic notification of such order to be forwarded to the Department of State Police. Such electronic notification shall contain the petitioner's full name, date of birth, sex, race, and social security number, if available, and the full name used by the petitioner at the time of arrest or summons, as well as the petitioner's state identification number from the criminal history record, the court case number of the charge or conviction to be sealed, if available, and the document control number, if available. Upon receipt of such electronic notification, the Department of State Police shall seal such records in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.13/'>19.2-392.13</a>. When sealing such charge or conviction, the Department of State Police shall include a notation on the criminal history record that such offense was sealed pursuant to this section. The Department of State Police shall also electronically notify the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court and any other agencies and individuals known to maintain or to have obtained such a record that such record has been ordered to be sealed and may only be disseminated in accordance with § <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.13/'>19.2-392.13</a> and pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-128/'>9.1-128</a> and the procedures adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-134/'>9.1-134</a>.</p><p>J. Costs shall be as provided by § <a href='/vacode/17.1-275/'>17.1-275</a> but shall not be recoverable against the Commonwealth. Any costs collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Sealing Fee Fund created pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/17.1-205.1/'>17.1-205.1</a>.</p><p>K. Any order entered where (i) the court or parties failed to strictly comply with the procedures set forth in this section or (ii) the court enters an order for the sealing of records contrary to law shall be voidable upon motion and notice made within two years of the entry of such order.</p><p>L. If a petitioner qualifies to file a petition for sealing of records without the payment of fees and costs pursuant to subsection B and has requested court-appointed counsel, the court shall then appoint counsel to file the petition for sealing of records and represent the petitioner in the sealed records proceedings. Counsel appointed to represent such a petitioner shall be compensated for his services subject to guidelines issued by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, in a total amount not to exceed $120, as determined by the court, and such compensation shall be paid from the Sealing Fee Fund as provided in § <a href='/vacode/17.1-205.1/'>17.1-205.1</a>.</p><p>M. A petition filed under this section and any responsive pleadings filed by the attorney for the Commonwealth shall be maintained under seal by the clerk unless otherwise ordered by the court. Any order to seal issued pursuant to this section shall be sealed and may only be disseminated for the purposes set forth in § <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.13/'>19.2-392.13</a> and pursuant to rules and regulations adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-128/'>9.1-128</a> and procedures adopted pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/9.1-134/'>9.1-134</a>.</p><p>N. A conviction or deferral and dismissal of § <a href='/vacode/18.2-36.1/'>18.2-36.1</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-36.2/'>18.2-36.2</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-51.4/'>18.2-51.4</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-51.5/'>18.2-51.5</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-57.2/'>18.2-57.2</a>, <a href='/vacode/18.2-266/'>18.2-266</a>, or <a href='/vacode/46.2-341.24/'>46.2-341.24</a> is ineligible for the sealing of records under this section.</p><p>O. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the circuit court from entering an order to seal a charge or conviction under this section when such charge or conviction is eligible for sealing under some other section of this chapter.</p><p>2021, Sp.

Upon receipt of an order directing that an offense be sealed, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall seal all records if the federal regulatory record retention period has run and all federal program requirements associated with a suspension have been satisfied.

The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of sealed criminal history record information or any information from such records among law-enforcement officers and attorneys when such disclosures are made by such officers or attorneys while engaged in the performance of their duties for purposes solely relating to the disclosure or use of exculpatory, mitigating, and impeachment evidence or between attorneys for the Commonwealth when related to the prosecution of a separate crime.</p><p>2021, Sp.

If a business screening service knows that a criminal history record or a traffic history record has been sealed, the business screening service shall promptly delete the record.</p><p>C. A business screening service shall register with the Department of State Police to electronically receive copies of orders of sealing provided to the Department of State Police pursuant to §§ <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.7/'>19.2-392.7</a>, <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.10/'>19.2-392.10</a>, <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.11/'>19.2-392.11</a>, and <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.12/'>19.2-392.12</a>. The Department of State Police may charge an annual licensing fee to the business screening service for accessing such information, with a portion of such fee to be used to cover the cost of providing such records and the remainder of such fee to be deposited into the Sealing Fee Fund pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/17.1-205.1/'>17.1-205.1</a>. The contract between the Department of State Police and the business screening service shall prohibit dissemination of the orders of sealing and shall require compliance by the business screening service with the provisions of subsections D, E, and F. The orders of sealing received by the business screening service shall remain confidential and shall not be disseminated or resold. The orders of sealing shall be used for the sole purpose of deleting criminal history records that have been sealed. The business screening service shall destroy the copies of the orders of sealing after deleting the information contained in such orders from sealed records. The Department of State Police shall require that the business screening service seeking access to the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose. The Department of State Police shall further require that a business screening service acknowledge receipt of all electronic copies of orders of sealing provided by the Department of State Police. The Department of State Police shall maintain a public list within its website identifying the business screening services that are licensed to receive such records.</p><p>D. A business screening service that disseminates a criminal history record or a traffic history record on or after the effective date of this section shall include the date when the record was collected by the business screening service and a notice that the information may include records that have been sealed since that date.</p><p>E. A business screening service shall implement and follow reasonable procedures to assure that it does not maintain or sell criminal history records or traffic history records that are inaccurate or incomplete. If the completeness or accuracy of a criminal history record or traffic history record maintained by a business screening service is disputed by the individual who is the subject of the record, the business screening service shall, without charge, investigate the disputed record. If, upon investigation, the business screening service determines that the record does not accurately reflect the content of the official record, the business screening service shall correct the disputed record so as to accurately reflect the content of the official record. If the disputed record is found to have been sealed pursuant to § <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.7/'>19.2-392.7</a>, <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.10/'>19.2-392.10</a>, <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.11/'>19.2-392.11</a>, or <a href='/vacode/19.2-392.12/'>19.2-392.12</a>, the business screening service shall promptly delete the record. A business screening service may terminate an investigation of a disputed record if the business screening service reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous, which may be based on the failure of the subject of the record to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed record. Upon making a determination that the dispute is frivolous, the business screening service shall inform the subject of the record of the specific reasons why it has determined that the dispute is frivolous and shall provide a description of any information required to investigate the disputed record. The business screening service shall notify the subject of the disputed record of the correction or deletion of the record or of the termination or completion of the investigation related to the record within 30 days of the date when the business screening service receives notice of the dispute from the subject of the record.</p><p>F. A business screening service shall implement procedures for individuals to submit a request to obtain their own criminal history record and traffic history record information maintained by the business screening service and any other information that may be sold to another entity by the business screening service regarding the individual.</p><p>G. A business screening service that violates this section is liable to the person who is the subject of the criminal history record or traffic history record for a penalty of $1,000 or actual damages caused by the violation, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney fees. Within 10 days of service of any suit by an individual, the business screening service may make a cure offer in writing to the individual claiming to have suffered a loss as a result of a violation of this section. Such offer shall be in writing and include one or more things of value, including the payment of money. A cure offer shall be reasonably calculated to remedy a loss claimed by the individual, as well as any attorney fees or other fees, expenses, or other costs of any kind that such individual may incur in relation to such loss. No cure offer shall be admissible in any proceeding initiated under this section, unless the cure offer is delivered by the business screening service to the individual claiming loss or to any attorney representing such individual prior to the filing of the business screening service's initial responsive pleading in such proceeding. The business screening service shall not be liable for such individual's attorney fees and court costs incurred following delivery of the cure offer unless the actual damages found to have been sustained and awarded, without consideration of attorney fees and court costs, exceed the value of the cure offer.</p><p>H. The Attorney General may file a civil action to enforce this section. If the court finds that a business screening service has willfully engaged in an act or practice in violation of this section, the Attorney General may recover for the Literary Fund, upon petition to the court, a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 per violation. For the purposes of this section, prima facie evidence of a willful violation may be shown when the Attorney General notifies the alleged violator by certified mail that an act or practice is a violation of this section and the alleged violator, after receipt of said notice, continues to engage in the act or practice. In any civil action pursuant to this subsection, in addition to any civil penalty awarded, the Attorney General may also recover any costs and reasonable expenses incurred by the state in investigating and preparing the case, not to exceed $1,000 per violation, and attorney fees. Such additional costs and expenses shall be paid into the general fund of the Commonwealth.</p><p>I. A business screening service that disseminates criminal history records or traffic history records in the Commonwealth is deemed to have consented to service of process in the Commonwealth and to the jurisdiction of courts of the Commonwealth for actions involving a violation of this section or for the recovery of remedies under this section.</p><p>J. A business screening service that is a consumer reporting agency and that is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6801 et seq., is considered to be in compliance with the comparable provisions of this section. A business screening service is subject to the state remedies under this section if its actions would violate this section and federal law.</p><p>K. Any business screening service or person who engages in the conduct of a business screening service, as set forth this this section, that fails to register with the Department of State Police as required by subsection C and that disseminates criminal history records or traffic history records in the Commonwealth may be subject to (i) suit by any person injured by such dissemination and (ii) enforcement actions by the Attorney General as set forth in subsection H.</p><p>2021, Sp.

The proceeding shall be instituted by filing with the court a petition:</p><p>1. Directed against the book by name or description;</p><p>2. Alleging the obscene nature of the book; and</p><p>3. Listing the names and addresses, if known, of the author, publisher, and all other persons interested in its sale or commercial distribution.</p><p>C. Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to this article, the court in term or in vacation shall forthwith examine the book alleged to be obscene. If the court find no probable cause to believe the book obscene, the judge thereof shall dismiss the petition; but if the court find probable cause to believe the book obscene, the judge thereof shall issue an order to show cause why the book should not be adjudicated obscene.</p><p>D. The order to show cause shall be:</p><p>1. Directed against the book by name or description;</p><p>2.

If no one appears and files an answer on or before the return date specified in the order to show cause, the court, upon being satisfied that the book is obscene, shall order the clerk of court to enter judgment that the book is obscene, but the court in its discretion may except from its judgment a restricted category of persons to whom the book is not obscene.</p><p>H.

The court shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the rules of civil procedure applicable to the trial of cases by the court without a jury. At the hearing, the court shall receive evidence, including the testimony of experts, if such evidence be offered, pertaining to:</p><p>1. The artistic, literary, medical, scientific, cultural and educational values, if any, of the book considered as a whole;</p><p>2. The degree of public acceptance of the book, or books of similar character, within the county or city in which the proceeding is brought;</p><p>3. The intent of the author and publisher of the book;</p><p>4. The reputation of the author and publisher;</p><p>5. The advertising, promotion, and other circumstances relating to the sale of the book;</p><p>6. The nature of classes of persons, including scholars, scientists, and physicians, for whom the book may not have prurient appeal, and who may be subject to exception pursuant to subsection G.</p><p>I.

Any objection by counsel for the accused, or the accused if he is proceeding pro se, to timeliness of the receipt of notice required by subsection G shall be made before hearing or trial upon his receipt of actual notice unless the accused did not receive actual notice prior to hearing or trial. A showing by the Commonwealth that the notice was mailed, delivered, or otherwise provided in compliance with the time requirements of this section shall constitute prima facie evidence that the notice was timely received by the accused. If the court finds upon the accused's objection made pursuant to this subsection, that he did not receive timely notice pursuant to subsection G, the accused's objection shall not be deemed waived and if the objection is made prior to hearing or trial, a continuance shall be ordered if requested by either party.
