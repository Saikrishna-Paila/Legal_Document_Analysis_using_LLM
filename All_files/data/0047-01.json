And the court determined he should. It was also insisted that some children by a second wife, (whose mother had by a marriage contract reserved a right of appointing her own slaves at her death as she pleased,) should bring into hotchpot whatever they should get under such appointment, or not be entitled to take with the children of the first marriage, a proportionable part of the value of the father\u2019s proper slaves. But the court determined that the right of hotchpot, does not take place in dividing the value of slaves.",
