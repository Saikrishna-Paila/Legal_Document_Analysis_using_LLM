        "text": "Opinion\nBARROW, J.\nThis is an appeal of a denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner held under a governor\u2019s warrant issued in response to a requisition for extradition. The appellant, Thomas W. Manning (Manning), contends that the trial court erred in not hearing evidence to determine whether he was in New Jersey, the demanding state, at the time the crimes he is charged with were committed. We conclude that the trial court did not err.\nManning\u2019s contention relies on the authority of a court in an asylum state to determine whether a petitioner seeking release on habeas corpus is a \u201cfugitive.\u201d Michigan v. Doran, 439 U.S. 282, 289 (1978). Since a \u201cfugitive\u201d is one who leaves the demanding state \u201cafter having incurred guilt there,\u201d Strassheim v. Dailey, 221 U.S. 280, 285 (1911), Manning argues that the habeas court must determine whether he was in New Jersey at the time the crime was committed.\nAccording to affidavits admitted into evidence in this proceeding, a New Jersey state trooper was shot and killed on December 21, 1981, after stopping a blue Chevrolet Nova in Knowlton, New Jersey. A passerby had seen someone exit the Chevrolet and fire numerous shots in the direction of the trooper, who had fallen to the ground. The driver and a passenger fled in the Chevrolet which was later found, bullet-damaged, about seven miles from the homicide scene.\nA bullet jacket identified as having been fired by the trooper\u2019s revolver was found in the Chevrolet. Latent fingerprints, later identified as Manning\u2019s, were found on items in the automobile and on the automobile\u2019s fender. A driver\u2019s license, bearing a name other than Manning\u2019s but bearing Manning\u2019s photograph, was found on the automobile\u2019s dashboard. Although the vehicle was registered in a name other than Manning\u2019s, a witness identified Manning as its owner.\nSeveral hours after the homicide, a collect telephone call to Manning\u2019s residence in Pennsylvania was made from a public telephone booth approximately one-quarter mile from the abandoned automobile. Shortly after the homicide, Manning, his wife and their children abandoned their residence, leaving behind their dog and numerous household items.\nManning\u2019s counsel proffered a description of the evidence he would have presented on behalf of Manning. Manning\u2019s wife would have testified that she and Manning were at their home in Marshall\u2019s Creek, Pennsylvania, the entire day on which the homicide occurred. Manning\u2019s landlord would have testified that Manning and his wife were living at their residence in Marshall\u2019s Creek, Pennsylvania, on the day the homicide occurred. He also described the anticipated testimony of the officer in charge of the investigation in New Jersey which suggested weaknesses in the demanding state\u2019s evidence.\nManning\u2019s evidence attempted to contradict the evidence of the demanding state by relying on an alibi. However, a habeas court in an asylum state cannot discharge one who has been arrested under a governor\u2019s warrant \u201cwhere there is merely contradictory evidence on the subject of presence in or absence from the State, as habeas corpus is not the proper proceeding to try the question of alibi, or any question as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d Munsey v. Clough, 196 U.S. 364, 375 (1905); see also South Carolina v. Bailey, 289 U.S. 412, 421 (1933); Pakulski v. Hickey, 731 F.2d 382, 389 (6th Cir. 1984). Only \u201cwhen it is conclusively proved that no question can be made, that the person was not within the demanding state when the crime is said to have been committed. . . .\u201d is he to be released. South Carolina v. Bailey, 289 U.S. at 421 (quoting Munsey v. Clough, 196 U.S. at 375).\nTherefore, even if Manning\u2019s evidence had been formally introduced, the habeas court could not have granted Manning\u2019s petition and released him. Thus the error, if any, was harmless, and the judgment will be affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nBaker, J., and Moon, J., concurred.\nInterstate extradition finds its source in the United States Constitution. Clause 2 of section 2, article IV provides:\n\u201cA person charged in any state with treason, felony or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on demand of the exective authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.\u201d\nThe constitutional mandate is implemented by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-85 to 118.",
