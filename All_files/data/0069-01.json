Afterwards, the widow dj'ing, the heir at law brought his bill for the slaves allotted her, insisting that by the devise of personal estate, slaves did not pass. But the court dismissed the bill ; two of the judges, the Secretary T. Nelson and Page, declaring their opinions in favor of the defendant, were founded on the partition made between the heir and widow, and that, had the question been simply, whether slaves would pass by a devise of personal estate, they should have determined it in the negative: in which they were not contradicted by the other judges. Present T. Nelson, Lee, Byrd, Burwell, Fairfax, Page and Wormley.",
