For the plaintiff, it was insisted, that by the act of the 4 Ann. 23. they were entitled to a share of the value, their father being intestate as to these slaves. For the defendants, it was said, that there was an exception in the act of the widow\u2019s dower, the value of which was not to be devised among the younger children, and that these slaves were intended by the' testator in lieu of the widow\u2019s dower, and therefore not to be divided.\nReported by Edward Barradall, Esq.\nAnd of that opinion was the whole Court.",
